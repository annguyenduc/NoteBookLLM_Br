Preface
Over the past 20 years, I’ve spent many of my working hours manipulating data
with SQL. For most of those years, I’ve worked in technology companies
spanning a wide range of consumer and business-to-business industries. In that
time, volumes of data have increased dramatically, and the technology I get to
use has improved by leaps and bounds. Databases are faster than ever, and the
reporting and visualization tools used to communicate the meaning in the data
are more powerful than ever. One thing that has remained remarkably constant,
however, is SQL being a key part of my toolbox.
I remember when I first learned SQL. I started my career in finance, where
spreadsheets rule, and I’d gotten pretty good at writing formulas and memorizing
all those keyboard shortcuts. One day I totally geeked out and Ctrl- and Alt-
clicked every key on my keyboard just to see what would happen (and then
created a cheat sheet for my peers). That was part fun and part survival: the
faster I was with my spreadsheets, the more likely I would be to finish my work
before midnight so I could go home and get some sleep. Spreadsheet mastery got
me in the door at my next role, a startup where I was first introduced to
databases and SQL.
Part of my role involved crunching inventory data in spreadsheets, and thanks to
early internet scale, the data sets were sometimes tens of thousands of rows. This
was “big data” at the time, at least for me. I got in the habit of going for a cup of
coffee or for lunch while my computer’s CPU was occupied with running its
vlookup magic. One day my manager went on vacation and asked me to tend to
the data warehouse he’d built on his laptop using Access. Refreshing the data
involved a series of steps: running SQL queries in a portal, loading the resulting
csv files into the database, and then refreshing the spreadsheet reports. After the
first successful load, I started tinkering, trying to understand how it worked, and
pestering the engineers to show me how to modify the SQL queries.
I was hooked, and even when I thought I might change directions with my
career, I’ve kept coming back to data. Manipulating data, answering questions,
helping my colleagues work better and smarter, and learning about businesses

## Page 6

and the world through sets of data have never stopped feeling fun and exciting.
When I started working with SQL, there weren’t many learning resources. I got a
book on basic syntax, read it in a night, and from there mostly learned through
trial and error. Back in the days when I was learning, I queried production
databases directly and brought the website down more than once with my overly
ambitious (or more likely just poorly written) SQL. Fortunately my skills
improved, and over the years I learned to work forward from the data in tables,
and backward from the output needed, solving technical and logic challenges
and puzzles to write queries that returned the right data. I ended up designing
and building data warehouses to gather data from different sources and avoid
bringing down critical production databases. I’ve learned a lot about when and
how to aggregate data before writing the SQL query and when to leave data in a
more raw form.
I’ve compared notes with others who got into data around the same time, and it’s
clear we mostly learned in the same ad hoc way. The lucky among us had peers
with whom to share techniques. Most SQL texts are either introductory and basic
(there’s definitely a place for these!) or else aimed at database developers. There
are few resources for advanced SQL users who are focused on analysis work.
Knowledge tends to be locked up in individuals or small teams. A goal of this
book is to change that, giving practitioners a reference for how to solve common
analysis problems with SQL, and I hope inspiring new inquiries into data using
techniques you might not have seen before.

Acknowledgments
This book wouldn’t have been possible without the efforts of a number of people
at O’Reilly. Andy Kwan recruited me to this project. Amelia Blevins and Shira
Evans guided me through the process and gave helpful feedback along the way.
Kristen Brown shepherded the book through the production process. Arthur
Johnson improved the quality and clarity of the text and inadvertently made me
think more deeply about SQL keywords.
Many colleagues over the years played an important role in my SQL journey,
and I’m grateful for their tutorials, tips, and shared code, and the time spent
brainstorming ways to solve analysis problems over the years. Sharon Lin
opened my eyes to regular expressions. Elyse Gordon gave me lots of book-
writing advice. Dave Hoch and our conversations about experiment analysis
inspired Chapter 7. Dan, Jim, and Stu from the Star Chamber have long been my
favorite guys to geek out with. I’m also grateful for all of the colleagues who

## Page 10

asked hard questions over the years—and once those were answered, asked even
harder ones.
I’d like to thank my husband Rick, son Shea, daughters Lily and Fiona, and
mom Janet for their love, encouragement, and most of all the gift of time to work
on this book. Amy, Halle, Jessi, and the Den of Slack kept me sane and laughing
through months of writing and pandemic lockdown.

Chapter 1. Analysis with SQL
If you’re reading this book, you’re probably interested in data analysis and in
using SQL to accomplish it. You may be experienced with data analysis but new
to SQL, or perhaps you’re experienced with SQL but new to data analysis. Or
you may be new to both topics entirely. Whatever your starting point, this
chapter lays the groundwork for the topics covered in the rest of the book and
makes sure we have a common vocabulary. I’ll start with a discussion of what
data analysis is and then move on to a discussion of SQL: what it is, why it’s so
popular, how it compares to other tools, and how it fits into data analysis. Then,
since modern data analysis is so intertwined with the technologies that have
enabled it, I’ll conclude with a discussion of different types of databases that you
may encounter in your work, why they’re used, and what all of that means for
the SQL you write.
What Is Data Analysis?
Collecting and storing data for analysis is a very human activity. Systems to
track stores of grain, taxes, and the population go back thousands of years, and
the roots of statistics date back hundreds of years. Related disciplines, including
statistical process control, operations research, and cybernetics, exploded in the
20th century. Many different names are used to describe the discipline of data
analysis, such as business intelligence (BI), analytics, data science, and decision
science, and practitioners have a range of job titles. Data analysis is also done by
marketers, product managers, business analysts, and a variety of other people. In
this book, I’ll use the terms data analyst and data scientist interchangeably to
mean the person working with SQL to understand data. I will refer to the
software used to build reports and dashboards as BI tools.
Data analysis in the contemporary sense was enabled by, and is intertwined with,
the history of computing. Trends in both research and commercialization have
shaped it, and the story includes a who’s who of researchers and major
companies, which we’ll talk about in the section on SQL. Data analysis blends

## Page 12

the power of computing with techniques from traditional statistics. Data analysis
is part data discovery, part data interpretation, and part data communication.
Very often the purpose of data analysis is to improve decision making, by
humans and increasingly by machines through automation.
Sound methodology is critical, but analysis is about more than just producing the
right number. It’s about curiosity, asking questions, and the “why” behind the
numbers. It’s about patterns and anomalies, discovering and interpreting clues
about how businesses and humans behave. Sometimes analysis is done on a data
set gathered to answer a specific question, as in a scientific setting or an online
experiment. Analysis is also done on data that is generated as a result of doing
business, as in sales of a company’s products, or that is generated for analytics
purposes, such as user interaction tracking on websites and mobile apps. This
data has a wide range of possible applications, from troubleshooting to planning
user interface (UI) improvements, but it often arrives in a format and volume
such that the data needs processing before yielding answers. Chapter 2 will
cover preparing data for analysis, and Chapter 8 will discuss some of the ethical
and privacy concerns with which all data practitioners should be familiar.
It’s hard to think of an industry that hasn’t been touched by data analysis:
manufacturing, retail, finance, health care, education, and even government have
all been changed by it. Sports teams have employed data analysis since the early
years of Billy Beane’s term as general manager of the Oakland Athletics, made
famous by Michael Lewis’s book Moneyball (Norton). Data analysis is used in
marketing, sales, logistics, product development, user experience design, support
centers, human resources, and more. The combination of techniques,
applications, and computing power has led to the explosion of related fields such
as data engineering and data science.
Data analysis is by definition done on historical data, and it’s important to
remember that the past doesn’t necessarily predict the future. The world is
dynamic, and organizations are dynamic as well—new products and processes
are introduced, competitors rise and fall, sociopolitical climates change.
Criticisms are leveled against data analysis for being backward looking. Though
that characterization is true, I have seen organizations gain tremendous value
from analyzing historical data. Mining historical data helps us understand the
characteristics and behavior of customers, suppliers, and processes. Historical

## Page 13

data can help us develop informed estimates and predicted ranges of outcomes,
which will sometimes be wrong but quite often will be right. Past data can point
out gaps, weaknesses, and opportunities. It allows organizations to optimize,
save money, and reduce risk and fraud. It can also help organizations find
opportunity, and it can become the building blocks of new products that delight
customers.
NOTE
Organizations that don’t do some form of data analysis are few and far between these days, but
there are still some holdouts. Why do some organizations not use data analysis? One argument
is the cost-to-value ratio. Collecting, processing, and analyzing data takes work and some level
of financial investment. Some organizations are too new, or they’re too haphazard. If there
isn’t a consistent process, it’s hard to generate data that’s consistent enough to analyze. Finally,
there are ethical considerations. Collecting or storing data about certain people in certain
situations may be regulated or even banned. Data about children and health-care interventions
is sensitive, for example, and there are extensive regulations around its collection. Even
organizations that are otherwise data driven need to take care around customer privacy and to
think hard about what data should be collected, why it is needed, and how long it should be
stored. Regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or
GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, have changed the way businesses
think about consumer data. We’ll discuss these regulations in more depth in Chapter 8. As data
practitioners, we should always be thinking about the ethical implications of our work.
When working with organizations, I like to tell people that data analysis is not a
project that wraps up at a fixed date—it’s a way of life. Developing a data-
informed mindset is a process, and reaping the rewards is a journey. Unknowns
become known, difficult questions are chipped away at until there are answers,
and the most critical information is embedded in dashboards that power tactical
and strategic decisions. With this information, new and harder questions are
asked, and then the process repeats.
Data analysis is both accessible for those looking to get started and hard to
master. The technology can be learned, particularly SQL. Many problems, such
as optimizing marketing spend or detecting fraud, are familiar and translate
across businesses. Every organization is different and every data set has quirks,
so even familiar problems can pose new challenges. Communicating results is a
skill. Learning to make good recommendations and becoming a trusted partner
to an organization take time. In my experience, simple analysis presented

## Page 14

persuasively has more impact than sophisticated analysis presented poorly.
Successful data analysis also requires partnership. You can have great insights,
but if there is no one to execute on them, you haven’t really made an impact.
Even with all the technology, it’s still about people, and relationships matter.
Why SQL?
This section describes what SQL is, the benefits of using it, how it compares to
other languages commonly used for analysis, and finally how SQL fits into the
analysis workflow.
What Is SQL?
SQL is the language used to communicate with databases. The acronym stands
for Structured Query Language and is pronounced either like “sequel” or by
saying each letter, as in “ess cue el.” This is only the first of many controversies
and inconsistencies surrounding SQL that we’ll see, but most people will know
what you mean regardless of how you say it. There is some debate as to whether
SQL is or isn’t a programming language. It isn’t a general purpose language in
the way that C or Python are. SQL without a database and data in tables is just a
text file. SQL can’t build a website, but it is powerful for working with data in
databases. On a practical level, what matters most is that SQL can help you get
the job of data analysis done.
IBM was the first to develop SQL databases, from the relational model invented
by Edgar Codd in the 1960s. The relational model was a theoretical description
for managing data using relationships. By creating the first databases, IBM
helped to advance the theory, but it also had commercial considerations, as did
Oracle, Microsoft, and every other company that has commercialized a database
since. From the beginning, there has been tension between computer theory and
commercial reality. SQL became an International Organization for Standards
(ISO) standard in 1987 and an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
standard in 1986. Although all major databases start from these standards in their
implementation of SQL, many have variations and functions that make life
easier for the users of those databases. These come at the cost of making SQL
more difficult to move between databases without some modifications.

## Page 15

SQL is used to access, manipulate, and retrieve data from objects in a database.
Databases can have one or more schemas, which provide the organization and
structure and contain other objects. Within a schema, the objects most commonly
used in data analysis are tables, views, and functions. Tables contain fields,
which hold the data. Tables may have one or more indexes; an index is a special
kind of data structure that allows data to be retrieved more efficiently. Indexes
are usually defined by a database administrator. Views are essentially stored
queries that can be referenced in the same way as a table. Functions allow
commonly used sets of calculations or procedures to be stored and easily
referenced in queries. They are usually created by a database administrator, or
DBA. Figure 1-1 gives an overview of the organization of databases.

## Page 17

Figure 1-1. Overview of database organization and objects in a database
To communicate with databases, SQL has four sublanguages for tackling
different jobs, and these are mostly standard across database types. Most people
who work in data analysis don’t need to recall the names of these sublanguages
on a daily basis, but they might come up in conversation with database
administrators or data engineers, so I’ll briefly introduce them. The commands
all work fluidly together, and some may coexist in the same SQL statement.
DQL, or data query language, is what this book is mainly about. It’s used for
querying data, which you can think of as using code to ask questions of a
database. DQL commands include SELECT, which will be familiar to prior users
of SQL, but the acronym DQL is not frequently used in my experience. SQL
queries can be as short as a single line or span many tens of lines. SQL queries
can access a single table (or view), can combine data from multiple tables
through the use of joins, and can also query across multiple schemas in the same
database. SQL queries generally cannot query across databases, but in some
cases clever network settings or additional software can be used to retrieve data
from multiple sources, even databases of different types. SQL queries are self-
contained and, apart from tables, do not reference variables or outputs from
previous steps not contained in the query, unlike scripting languages.
DDL, or data definition language, is used to create and modify tables, views,
users, and other objects in the database. It affects the structure but not the
contents. There are three common commands: CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.
CREATE is used to make new objects. ALTER changes the structure of an object,
such as by adding a column to a table. DROP deletes the entire object and its
structure. You might hear DBAs and data engineers talk about working with
DDLs—this is really just shorthand for the files or pieces of code that do the
creates, alters, or drops. An example of how DDL is used in the context of
analysis is the code to create temporary tables.
DCL, or data control language, is used for access control. Commands include
GRANT and REVOKE, which give permission and remove permission,
respectively. In an analysis context, GRANT might be needed to allow a
colleague to query a table you created. You might also encounter such a
command when someone has told you a table exists in the database but you can’t
see it—permissions might need to be GRANTed to your user.

## Page 18

DML, or data manipulation language, is used to act on the data itself. The
commands are INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. INSERT adds new records and
is essentially the “load” step in extract, transform, load (ETL). UPDATE changes
values in a field, and DELETE removes rows. You will encounter these
commands if you have any kind of self-managed tables—temp tables, sandbox
tables—or if you find yourself in the role of both owner and analyzer of the
database.
These four sublanguages are present in all major databases. In this book, I’ll
focus mainly on DQL. We will touch on a few DDL and DML commands in
Chapter 8, and you will also see some examples in the GitHub site for the book,
where they are used to create and populate the data used in examples. Thanks to
this common set of commands, SQL code written for any database will look
familiar to anyone used to working with SQL. However, reading SQL from
another database may feel a bit like listening to someone who speaks the same
language as you but comes from another part of the country or the world. The
basic structure of the language is the same, but the slang is different, and some
words have different meanings altogether. Variations in SQL from database to
database are often termed dialects, and database users will reference Oracle
SQL, MSSQL, or other dialects.
Still, once you know SQL, you can work with different database types as long as
you pay attention to details such as the handling of nulls, dates, and timestamps;
the division of integers; and case sensitivity.
This book uses PostgreSQL, or Postgres, for the examples, though I will try to
point out where the code would be meaningfully different in other types of
databases. You can install Postgres on a personal computer in order to follow
along with the examples.
Benefits of SQL
There are many good reasons to use SQL for data analysis, from computing
power to its ubiquity in data analysis tools and its flexibility.
Perhaps the best reason to use SQL is that much of the world’s data is already in
databases. It’s likely your own organization has one or more databases. Even if
data is not already in a database, loading it into one can be worthwhile in order

## Page 19

to take advantage of the storage and computing advantages, especially when
compared to alternatives such as spreadsheets. Computing power has exploded
in recent years, and data warehouses and data infrastructure have evolved to take
advantage of it. Some newer cloud databases allow massive amounts of data to
be queried in memory, speeding things up further. The days of waiting minutes
or hours for query results to return may be over, though analysts may just write
more complex queries in response.
SQL is the de facto standard for interacting with databases and retrieving data
from them. A wide range of popular software connects to databases with SQL,
from spreadsheets to BI and visualization tools and coding languages such as
Python and R (discussed in the next section). Due to the computing resources
available, performing as much data manipulation and aggregation as possible in
the database often has advantages downstream. We’ll discuss strategies for
building complex data sets for downstream tools in depth in Chapter 8.
The basic SQL building blocks can be combined in an endless number of ways.
Starting with a relatively small number of building blocks—the syntax—SQL
can accomplish a wide array of tasks. SQL can be developed iteratively, and it’s
easy to review the results as you go. It may not be a full-fledged programming
language, but it can do a lot, from transforming data to performing complex
calculations and answering questions.
Last, SQL is relatively easy to learn, with a finite amount of syntax. You can
learn the basic keywords and structure quickly and then hone your craft over
time working with varied data sets. Applications of SQL are virtually infinite,
when you take into account the range of data sets in the world and the possible
questions that can be asked of data. SQL is taught in many universities, and
many people pick up some skills on the job. Even employees who don’t already
have SQL skills can be trained, and the learning curve may be easier than that for
other programming languages. This makes storing data for analysis in relational
databases a logical choice for organizations.
SQL Versus R or Python
While SQL is a popular language for data analysis, it isn’t the only choice. R and
Python are among the most popular of the other languages used for data analysis.
R is a statistical and graphing language, while Python is a general-purpose

## Page 20

programming language that has strengths in working with data. Both are open
source, can be installed on a laptop, and have active communities developing
packages, or extensions, that tackle various data manipulation and analysis tasks.
Choosing between R and Python is beyond the scope of this book, but there are
many discussions online about the relative advantages of each. Here I will
consider them together as coding-language alternatives to SQL.
One major difference between SQL and other coding languages is where the
code runs and, therefore, how much computing power is available. SQL always
runs on a database server, taking advantage of all its computing resources. For
doing analysis, R and Python are usually run locally on your machine, so
computing resources are capped by whatever is available locally. There are, of
course, lots of exceptions: databases can run on laptops, and R and Python can
be run on servers with more resources. When you are performing anything other
than the simplest analysis on large data sets, pushing work onto a database server
with more resources is a good option. Since databases are usually set up to
continually receive new data, SQL is also a good choice when a report or
dashboard needs to update periodically.
A second difference is in how data is stored and organized. Relational databases
always organize data into rows and columns within tables, so SQL assumes this
structure for every query. R and Python have a wider variety of ways to store
data, including variables, lists, and dictionaries, among other options. These
provide more flexibility, but at the cost of a steeper learning curve. To facilitate
data analysis, R has data frames, which are similar to database tables and
organize data into rows and columns. The pandas package makes DataFrames
available in Python. Even when other options are available, the table structure
remains valuable for analysis.
Looping is another major difference between SQL and most other computer
programming languages. A loop is an instruction or a set of instructions that
repeats until a specified condition is met. SQL aggregations implicitly loop over
the set of data, without any additional code. We will see later how the lack of
ability to loop over fields can result in lengthy SQL statements when pivoting or
unpivoting data. While deeper discussion is beyond the scope of this book, some
vendors have created extensions to SQL, such as PL/SQL in Oracle and T-SQL
in Microsoft SQL Server, that allow functionality such as looping.

## Page 21

A drawback of SQL is that your data must be in a database,  whereas R and
Python can import data from files stored locally or can access files stored on
servers or websites. This is convenient for many one-off projects. A database can
be installed on a laptop, but this does add an extra layer of overhead. In the other
direction, packages such as dbplyr for R and SQLAlchemy for Python allow
programs written in those languages to connect to databases, execute SQL
queries, and use the results in further processing steps. In this sense, R or Python
can be complementary to SQL.
R and Python both have sophisticated statistical functions that are either built in
or available in packages. Although SQL has, for example, functions to calculate
average and standard deviation, calculations of p-values and statistical
significance that are needed in experiment analysis (discussed in Chapter 7)
cannot be performed with SQL alone. In addition to sophisticated statistics,
machine learning is another area that is better tackled with one of these other
coding languages.
When deciding whether to use SQL, R, or Python for an analysis, consider:
Where is the data located—in a database, a file, a website?
What is the volume of data?
Where is the data going—into a report, a visualization, a statistical
analysis?
Will it need to be updated or refreshed with new data? How often?
What does your team or organization use, and how important is it to
conform to existing standards?
There is no shortage of debate around which languages and tools are best for
doing data analysis or data science. As with many things, there’s often more than
one way to accomplish an analysis. Programming languages evolve and change
in popularity, and we’re lucky to live and work in a time with so many good
choices. SQL has been around for a long time and will likely remain popular for
years to come. The ultimate goal is to use the best available tool for the job. This
book will help you get the most out of SQL for data analysis, regardless of what
else is in your toolkit.

## Page 22

SQL as Part of the Data Analysis Workflow
Now that I’ve explained what SQL is, discussed some of its benefits, and
compared it to other languages, we’ll turn to a discussion of where SQL fits in
the data analysis process. Analysis work always starts with a question, which
may be about how many new customers have been acquired, how sales are
trending, or why some users stick around for a long time while others try a
service and never return. Once the question is framed, we consider where the
data originated, where the data is stored, the analysis plan, and how the results
will be presented to the audience. Figure 1-2 shows the steps in the process.
Queries and analysis are the focus of this book, though I will discuss the other
steps briefly in order to put the queries and analysis stage into a broader context.
Figure 1-2. Steps in the data analysis process
First, data is generated by source systems, a term that includes any human or
machine process that generates data of interest. Data can be generated by people
by hand, such as when someone fills out a form or takes notes during a doctor’s
visit. Data can also be machine generated, such as when an application database
records a purchase, an event-streaming system records a website click, or a
marketing management tool records an email open. Source systems can generate
many different types and formats of data, and Chapter 2 will discuss them, and
how the type of source may impact the analysis, in more detail.
The second step is moving the data and storing it in a database for analysis. I

will use the terms data warehouse, which is a database that consolidates data
from across an organization into a central repository, and data store, which refers
to any type of data storage system that can be queried. Other terms you might
come across are data mart, which is typically a subset of a data warehouse, or a
more narrowly focused data warehouse; and data lake, a term that can mean
either that data resides in a file storage system or that it is stored in a database
but without the degree of data transformation that is common in data
warehouses. Data warehouses range from small and simple to huge and
expensive. A database running on a laptop will be sufficient for you to follow
along with the examples in this book. What matters is having the data you need
to perform an analysis together in one place.
NOTE
Usually a person or team is responsible for getting data into the data warehouse. This process
is called ETL, or extract, transform, load. Extract pulls the data from the source system.
Transform optionally changes the structure of the data, performs data quality cleaning, or
aggregates the data. Load puts the data into the database. This process can also be called ELT,
for extract, load, transform—the difference being that, rather than transformations being done
before data is loaded, all the data is loaded and then transformations are performed, usually
using SQL. You might also hear the terms source and target in the context of ETL. The source
is where the data comes from, and the target is the destination, i.e., the database and the tables
within it. Even when SQL is used to do the transforming, another language such as Python or
Java is used to glue the steps together, coordinate scheduling, and raise alerts when something
goes wrong. There are a number of commercial products as well as open source tools
available, so teams don’t have to create an ETL system entirely from scratch.
Once the data is in a database, the next step is performing queries and analysis.
In this step, SQL is applied to explore, profile, clean, shape, and analyze the
data. Figure 1-3 shows the general flow of the process. Exploring the data
involves becoming familiar with the topic, where the data was generated, and the
database tables in which it is stored. Profiling involves checking the unique
values and distribution of records in the data set. Cleaning involves fixing
incorrect or incomplete data, adding categorization and flags, and handling null
values. Shaping is the process of arranging the data into the rows and columns
needed in the result set. Finally, analyzing the data involves reviewing the output
for trends, conclusions, and insights. Although this process is shown as linear, in
practice it is often cyclical—for example, when shaping or analysis reveals data

## Page 24

that should be cleaned.
Figure 1-3. Stages within the queries and analysis step of the analysis workflow
Presentation of the data into a final output form is the last step in the overall
workflow. Businesspeople won’t appreciate receiving a file of SQL code; they
expect you to present graphs, charts, and insights. Communication is key to
having an impact with analysis, and for that we need a way to share the results
with other people. At other times, you may need to apply more sophisticated
statistical analysis than is possible in SQL, or you may want to feed the data into
a machine learning (ML) algorithm. Fortunately, most reporting and
visualization tools have SQL connectors that allow you to pull in data from
entire tables or prewritten SQL queries. Statistical software and languages
commonly used for ML also usually have SQL connectors.
Analysis workflows encompass a number of steps and often include multiple
tools and technologies. SQL queries and analysis are at the heart of many
analyses and are what we will focus on in the following chapters. Chapter 2 will
discuss types of source systems and the types of data they generate. The rest of
this chapter will take a look at the types of databases you are likely to encounter
in your analysis journey.
Database Types and How to Work with Them
If you’re working with SQL, you’ll be working with databases. There is a range

## Page 25

of database types—open source to proprietary, row-store to column-store. There
are on-premises databases and cloud databases, as well as hybrid databases,
where an organization runs the database software on a cloud vendor’s
infrastructure. There are also a number of data stores that aren’t databases at all
but can be queried with SQL.
Databases are not all created equal; each database type has its strengths and
weaknesses when it comes to analysis work. Unlike tools used in other parts of
the analysis workflow, you may not have much say in which database
technology is used in your organization. Knowing the ins and outs of the
database you have will help you work more efficiently and take advantage of any
special SQL functions it offers. Familiarity with other types of databases will
help you if you find yourself working on a project to build or migrate to a new
data warehouse. You may want to install a database on your laptop for personal,
small-scale projects, or get an instance of a cloud warehouse for similar reasons.
Databases and data stores have been a dynamic area of technology development
since they were introduced. A few trends since the turn of the 21st century have
driven the technology in ways that are really exciting for data practitioners today.
First, data volumes have increased incredibly with the internet, mobile devices,
and the Internet of Things (IoT). In 2020 IDC predicted that the amount of data
stored globally will grow to 175 zettabytes by 2025. This scale of data is hard to
even think about, and not all of it will be stored in databases for analysis. It’s not
uncommon for companies to have data in the scale of terabytes and petabytes
these days, a scale that would have been impossible to process with the
technology of the 1990s and earlier. Second, decreases in data storage and
computing costs, along with the advent of the cloud, have made it cheaper and
easier for organizations to collect and store these massive amounts of data.
Computer memory has gotten cheaper, meaning that large amounts of data can
be loaded into memory, calculations performed, and results returned, all without
reading and writing to disk, greatly increasing the speed. Third, distributed
computing has allowed the breaking up of workloads across many machines.
This allows a large and tunable amount of computing to be pointed to complex
data tasks.
Databases and data stores have combined these technological trends in a number
of different ways in order to optimize for particular types of tasks. There are two

## Page 26

broad categories of databases that are relevant for analysis work: row-store and
column-store. In the next section I’ll introduce them, discuss what makes them
similar to and different from each other, and talk about what all of this means as
far as doing analysis with data stored in them. Finally, I’ll introduce some
additional types of data infrastructure beyond databases that you may encounter.
Row-Store Databases
Row-store databases—also called transactional databases—are designed to be
efficient at processing transactions: INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs.
Popular open source row-store databases include MySQL and Postgres. On the
commercial side, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Teradata are widely used.
Although they’re not really optimized for analysis, for a number of years row-
store databases were the only option for companies building data warehouses.
Through careful tuning and schema design, these databases can be used for
analytics. They are also attractive due to the low cost of open source options and
because they’re familiar to the database administrators who maintain them.
Many organizations replicate their production database in the same technology
as a first step toward building out data infrastructure. For all of these reasons,
data analysts and data scientists are likely to work with data in a row-store
database at some point in their career.
We think of a table as rows and columns, but data has to be serialized for
storage. A query searches a hard disk for the needed data. Hard disks are
organized in a series of blocks of a fixed size. Scanning the hard disk takes both
time and resources, so minimizing the amount of the disk that needs to be
scanned to return query results is important. Row-store databases approach this
problem by serializing data in a row. Figure 1-4 shows an example of row-wise
data storage. When querying, the whole row is read into memory. This approach
is fast when making row-wise updates, but it’s slower when making calculations
across many rows if only a few columns are needed.
Figure 1-4. Row-wise storage, in which each row is stored together on disk

## Page 27

To reduce the width of tables, row-store databases are usually modeled in third
normal form, which is a database design approach that seeks to store each piece
of information only once, to avoid duplication and inconsistencies. This is
efficient for transaction processing but often leads to a large number of tables in
the database, each with only a few columns. To analyze such data, many joins
may be required, and it can be difficult for nondevelopers to understand how all
of the tables relate to each other and where a particular piece of data is stored.
When doing analysis, the goal is usually denormalization, or getting all the data
together in one place.
Tables typically have a primary key that enforces uniqueness—in other words, it
prevents the database from creating more than one record for the same thing.
Tables will often have an id column that is an auto-incrementing integer, where
each new record gets the next integer after the last one inserted, or an
alphanumeric value that is created by a primary key generator. There should also
be a set of columns that together make the row unique; this combination of fields
is called a composite key, or sometimes a business key. For example, in a table of
people, the columns first_name, last_name, and birthdate together
might make the row unique. Social_security_id would also be a unique
identifier, in addition to the table’s person_id column.
Tables also optionally have indexes that make looking up specific records faster
and make joins involving these columns faster. Indexes store the values in the
field or fields indexed as single pieces of data along with a row pointer, and
since the indexes are smaller than the whole table, they are faster to scan.
Usually the primary key is indexed, but other fields or groups of fields can be
indexed as well. When working with row-store databases, it’s useful to get to
know which fields in the tables you use have indexes. Common joins can be
sped up by adding indexes, so it’s worth investigating whether analysis queries
take a long time to run. Indexes don’t come for free: they take up storage space,
and they slow down loading, as new values need to be added with each insert.
DBAs may not index everything that might be useful for analysis. Beyond
reporting, analysis work may not be routine enough to bother with optimizing
indexes either. Exploratory and complex queries often use complex join patterns,
and we may throw out one approach when we figure out a new way to solve a
problem.

## Page 28

Star schema modeling was developed in part to make row-store databases more
friendly to analytic workloads. The foundations are laid out in the book The
Data Warehouse Toolkit,  which advocates modeling the data as a series of fact
and dimension tables. Fact tables represent events, such as retail store
transactions. Dimensions hold descriptors such as customer name and product
type. Since data doesn’t always fit neatly into fact and dimension categories,
there’s an extension called the snowflake schema in which some dimensions
have dimensions of their own.
Column-Store Databases
Column-store databases took off in the early part of the 21st century, though
their theoretical history goes back as far as that of row-store databases. Column-
store databases store the values of a column together, rather than storing the
values of a row together. This design is optimized for queries that read many
records but not necessarily all the columns. Popular column-store databases
include Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, and Vertica.
Column-store databases are efficient at storing large volumes of data thanks to
compression. Missing values and repeating values can be represented by very
small marker values instead of the full value. For example, rather than storing
“United Kingdom” thousands or millions of times, a column-store database will
store a surrogate value that takes up very little storage space, along with a
lookup that stores the full “United Kingdom” value. Column-store databases also
compress data by taking advantage of repetitions of values in sorted data. For
example, the database can store the fact that the marker value for “United
Kingdom” is repeated 100 times, and this takes up even less space than storing
that marker 100 times.
Column-store databases do not enforce primary keys and do not have indexes.
Repeated values are not problematic, thanks to compression. As a result,
schemas can be tailored for analysis queries, with all the data together in one
place as opposed to being in multiple tables that need to be joined. Duplicate
data can easily sneak in without primary keys, however, so understanding the
source of the data and quality checking are important.
Updates and deletes are expensive in most column-store databases, since data for
a single row is distributed rather than stored together. For very large tables, a

## Page 29

write-only policy may exist, so we also need to know something about how the
data is generated in order to figure out which records to use. The data can also be
slower to read, as it needs to be uncompressed before calculations are applied.
Column-store databases are generally the gold standard for fast analysis work.
They use standard SQL (with some vendor-specific variations), and in many
ways working with them is no different from working with a row-store database
in terms of the queries you write. The size of the data matters, as do the
computing and storage resources that have been allocated to the database. I have
seen aggregations run across millions and billions of records in seconds. This
does wonders for productivity.
TIP
There are a few tricks to be aware of. Since certain types of compression rely on sorting,
knowing the fields that the table is sorted on and using them to filter queries improves
performance. Joining tables can be slow if both tables are large.
At the end of the day, some databases will be easier or faster to work with, but
there is nothing inherent in the type of database that will prevent you from
performing any of the analysis in this book. As with all things, using a tool that’s
properly powerful for the volume of data and complexity of the task will allow
you to focus on creating meaningful analysis.
Other Types of Data Infrastructure
Databases aren’t the only way data can be stored, and there is an increasing
variety of options for storing data needed for analysis and powering applications.
File storage systems, sometimes called data lakes, are probably the main
alternative to database warehouses. NoSQL databases and search-based data
stores are alternative data storage systems that offer low latency for application
development and searching log files. Although not typically part of the analysis
process, they are increasingly part of organizations’ data infrastructure, so I will
introduce them briefly in this section as well. One interesting trend to point out
is that although these newer types of infrastructure at first aimed to break away
from the confines of SQL databases, many have ended up implementing some

## Page 30

kind of SQL interface to query the data.
Hadoop, also known as HDFS (for “Hadoop distributed filesystem”), is an open
source file storage system that takes advantage of the ever-falling cost of data
storage and computing power, as well as distributed systems. Files are split into
blocks, and Hadoop distributes them across a filesystem that is stored on nodes,
or computers, in a cluster. The code to run operations is sent to the nodes, and
they process the data in parallel. Hadoop’s big breakthrough was to allow huge
amounts of data to be stored cheaply. Many large internet companies, with
massive amounts of often unstructured data, found this to be an advantage over
the cost and storage limitations of traditional databases. Hadoop’s early versions
had two major downsides: specialized coding skills were needed to retrieve and
process data since it was not SQL compatible, and execution time for the
programs was often quite long. Hadoop has since matured, and various tools
have been developed that allow SQL or SQL-like access to the data and speed up
query times.
Other commercial and open source products have been introduced in the last few
years to take advantage of cheap data storage and fast, often in-memory data
processing, while offering SQL querying ability. Some of them even permit the
analyst to write a single query that returns data from multiple underlying
sources. This is exciting for anyone who works with large amounts of data, and
it is validation that SQL is here to stay.
NoSQL is a technology that allows for data modeling that is not strictly
relational. It allows for very low latency storage and retrieval, critical in many
online applications. The class includes key-value pair storage and graph
databases, which store in a node-edge format, and document stores. Examples of
these data stores that you might hear about in your organization are Cassandra,
Couchbase, DynamoDB, Memcached, Giraph, and Neo4j. Early on, NoSQL was
marketed as making SQL obsolete, but the acronym has more recently been
marketed as “not only SQL.” For analysis purposes, using data stored in a
NoSQL key-value store for analysis typically requires moving it to a more
traditional SQL data warehouse, since NoSQL is not optimized for querying
many records at once. Graph databases have applications such as network
analysis, and analysis work may be done directly in them with special query
languages. The tool landscape is always evolving, however, and perhaps

## Page 31

someday we’ll be able to analyze this data with SQL as well.
Search-based data stores include Elasticsearch and Splunk. Elasticsearch and
Splunk are often used to analyze machine-generated data, such as logs. These
and similar technologies have non-SQL query languages, but if you know SQL,
you can often understand them. Recognizing how common SQL skills are, some
data stores, such as Elasticsearch, have added SQL querying interfaces. These
tools are useful and powerful for the use cases they were designed for, but
they’re usually not well suited to the types of analysis tasks this book is
covering. As I’ve explained to people over the years, they are great for finding
needles in haystacks. They’re not as great at measuring the haystack itself.
Regardless of the type of database or other data storage technology, the trend is
clear: even as data volumes grow and use cases become more complex, SQL is
still the standard tool for accessing data. Its large existing user base,
approachable learning curve, and power for analytical tasks mean that even
technologies that try to move away from SQL come back around and
accommodate it.
Conclusion
Data analysis is an exciting discipline with a range of applications for businesses
and other organizations. SQL has many benefits for working with data,
particularly any data stored in a database. Querying and analyzing data is part of
the larger analysis workflow, and there are several types of data stores that a data
scientist might expect to work with. Now that we’ve set the groundwork for
analysis, SQL, and data stores, the rest of the book will cover using SQL for
analysis in depth. Chapter 2 focuses on data preparation, starting with an
introduction to data types and then moving on to profiling, cleaning, and shaping
data. Chapters 3 through 7 present applications of data analysis, focusing on time
series analysis, cohort analysis, text analysis, anomaly detection, and experiment
analysis. Chapter 8 covers techniques for developing complex data sets for
further analysis in other tools. Finally, Chapter 9 concludes with thoughts on
how types of analysis can be combined for new insights and lists some
additional resources to support your analytics journey.

Chapter 2. Preparing Data for
Analysis
Estimates of how long data scientists spend preparing their data vary, but it’s
safe to say that this step takes up a significant part of the time spent working
with data. In 2014, the New York Times reported that data scientists spend from
50% to 80% of their time cleaning and wrangling their data. A 2016 survey by
CrowdFlower found that data scientists spend 60% of their time cleaning and
organizing data in order to prepare it for analysis or modeling work. Preparing
data is such a common task that terms have sprung up to describe it, such as data
munging, data wrangling, and data prep. (“Mung” is an acronym for Mash Until
No Good, which I have certainly done on occasion.) Is all this data preparation
work just mindless toil, or is it an important part of the process?
Data preparation is easier when a data set has a data dictionary, a document or
repository that has clear descriptions of the fields, possible values, how the data
was collected, and how it relates to other data. Unfortunately, this is frequently
not the case. Documentation often isn’t prioritized, even by people who see its
value, or it becomes out-of-date as new fields and tables are added or the way
data is populated changes. Data profiling creates many of the elements of a data
dictionary, so if your organization already has a data dictionary, this is a good
time to use it and contribute to it. If no data dictionary exists currently, consider
starting one! This is one of the most valuable gifts you can give to your team and
to your future self. An up-to-date data dictionary allows you to speed up the
data-profiling process by building on profiling that’s already been done rather
than replicating it. It will also improve the quality of your analysis results, since
you can verify that you have used fields correctly and applied appropriate filters.
Even when a data dictionary exists, you will still likely need to do data prep
work as part of the analysis. In this chapter, I’ll start with a review of data types
you are likely to encounter. This is followed by a review of SQL query structure.
Next, I will talk about profiling the data as a way to get to know its contents and
check for data quality. Then I’ll talk about some data-shaping techniques that

## Page 34

will return the columns and rows needed for further analysis. Finally, I’ll walk
through some useful tools for cleaning data to deal with any quality issues.
Types of Data
Data is the foundation of analysis, and all data has a database data type and also
belongs to one or more categories of data. Having a firm grasp of the many
forms data can take will help you be a more effective data analyst. I’ll start with
the database data types most frequently encountered in analysis. Then I’ll move
on to some conceptual groupings that can help us understand the source, quality,
and possible applications of the data.
Database Data Types
Fields in database tables all have defined data types. Most databases have good
documentation on the types they support, and this is a good resource for any
needed detail beyond what is presented here. You don’t necessarily need to be an
expert on the nuances of data types to be good at analysis, but later in the book
we’ll encounter situations in which considering the data type is important, so this
section will cover the basics. The main types of data are strings, numeric,
logical, and datetime, as summarized in Table 2-1. These are based on Postgres
but are similar across most major database types.
Table 2-1. A summary of common database data types
Type
Name
Description
String
CHAR / 
VARCHAR
Holds strings. A CHAR is always of fixed length, whereas a 
VARCHAR is of variable length, up to some maximum size 
(256 characters, for example).
 
TEXT / BLOB
Holds longer strings that don’t fit in a VARCHAR. 
Descriptions or free text entered by survey respondents might 
be held in these fields.
Numeric
INT / SMALLINT / 
BIGINT
Holds integers (whole numbers). Some databases have 
SMALLINT and/or BIGINT. SMALLINT can be used when 
the field will only hold values with a small number of digits. 
SMALLINT takes less memory than a regular INT. BIGINT is 
capable of holding numbers with more digits than an INT, but it 
takes up more space than an INT.

## Page 35

FLOAT / DOUBLE 
/ DECIMAL
Holds decimal numbers, sometimes with the number of decimal 
places specified.
Logical
BOOLEAN
Holds values of TRUE or FALSE.
 
DATETIME / 
TIMESTAMP
Holds dates with times. Typically in a YYYY-MM-DD 
hh:mi:ss format, where YYYY is the four-digit year, MM is the 
two-digit month number, DD is the two-digit day, hh is the two-
digit hour (usually 24-hour time, or values of 0 to 23), mi is the 
two-digit minutes, and ss is the two-digit seconds. Some 
databases store only timestamps without time zone, while 
others have specific types for timestamps with and without time 
zones.
 
TIME
Holds times.
String data types are the most versatile. These can hold letters, numbers, and
special characters, including unprintable characters like tabs and newlines.
String fields can be defined to hold a fixed or variable number of characters. A
CHAR field could be defined to allow only two characters to hold US state
abbreviations, for example, whereas a field storing the full names of states would
need to be a VARCHAR to allow a variable number of characters. Fields can be
defined as TEXT, CLOB (Character Large Object), or BLOB (Binary Large
Object, which can include additional data types such as images), depending on
the database to hold very long strings, though since they often take up a lot of
space, these data types tend to be used sparingly. When data is loaded, if strings
arrive that are too big for the defined data type, they may be truncated or rejected
entirely. SQL has a number of string functions that we will make use of for
various analysis purposes.
Numeric data types are all the ones that store numbers, both positive and
negative. Mathematical functions and operators can be applied to numeric fields.
Numeric data types include the INT types as well as FLOAT, DOUBLE, and
DECIMAL types that allow decimal places. Integer data types are often
implemented because they use less memory than their decimal counterparts. In
some databases, such as Postgres, dividing integers results in an integer, rather
than a value with decimal places as you might expect. We’ll discuss converting
numeric data types to obtain correct results later in this chapter.
The logical data type is called BOOLEAN. It has values of TRUE and FALSE
and is an efficient way to store information where these options are appropriate.
Operations that compare two fields return a BOOLEAN value as a result. This

## Page 36

data type is often used to create flags, fields that summarize the presence or
absence of a property in the data. For example, a table storing email data might
have a BOOLEAN has_opened field.
The datetime types include DATE, TIMESTAMP, and TIME. Date and time data
should be stored in a field of one of these database types whenever possible,
since SQL has a number of useful functions that operate on them. Timestamps
and dates are very common in databases and are critical to many types of
analysis, particularly time series analysis (covered in Chapter 3) and cohort
analysis (covered in Chapter 4). Chapter 3 will discuss date and time formatting,
transformations, and calculations.
Other data types, such as JSON and geographical types, are supported by some
but not all databases. I won’t go into detail on all of them here since they are
generally beyond the scope of this book. However, they are a sign that SQL
continues to evolve to tackle emerging analysis tasks.
Beyond database data types, there are a number of conceptual ways that data is
categorized. These can have an impact both on how data is stored and on how
we think about analyzing it. I will discuss these categorical data types next.
Structured Versus Unstructured
Data is often described as structured or unstructured, or sometimes as
semistructured. Most databases were designed to handle structured data, where
each attribute is stored in a column, and instances of each entity are represented
as rows. A data model is first created, and then data is inserted according to that
data model. For example, an address table might have fields for street address,
city, state, and postal code. Each row would hold a particular customer’s address.
Each field has a data type and allows only data of that type to be entered. When
structured data is inserted into a table, each field is verified to ensure it conforms
to the correct data type. Structured data is easy to query with SQL.
Unstructured data is the opposite of structured data. There is no predetermined
structure, data model, or data types. Unstructured data is often the “everything
else” that isn’t database data. Documents, emails, and web pages are
unstructured. Photos, images, videos, and audio files are also examples of
unstructured data. They don’t fit into the traditional data types, and thus they are

## Page 37

more difficult for relational databases to store efficiently and for SQL to query.
Unstructured data is often stored outside of relational databases as a result. This
allows data to be loaded quickly, but lack of data validation can result in low
data quality. As we saw in Chapter 1, the technology continues to evolve, and
new tools are being developed to allow SQL querying of many types of
unstructured data.
Semistructured data falls in between these two categories. Much “unstructured”
data has some structure that we can make use of. For example, emails have from
and to email addresses, subject lines, body text, and sent timestamps that can be
stored separately in a data model with those fields. Metadata, or data about data,
can be extracted from other file types and stored for analysis. For example,
music audio files might be tagged with artist, song name, genre, and duration.
Generally, the structured parts of semistructured data can be queried with SQL,
and SQL can often be used to parse or otherwise extract structured data for
further querying. We’ll see some applications of this in the discussion of text
analysis in Chapter 5.
Quantitative Versus Qualitative Data
Quantitative data is numeric. It measures people, things, and events.
Quantitative data can include descriptors, such as customer information, product
type, or device configurations, but it also comes with numeric information such
as price, quantity, or visit duration. Counts, sums, average, or other numeric
functions are applied to the data. Quantitative data is often machine generated
these days, but it doesn’t need to be. Height, weight, and blood pressure recorded
on a paper patient intake form are quantitative, as are student quiz scores typed
into a spreadsheet by a teacher.
Qualitative data is usually text based and includes opinions, feelings, and
descriptions that aren’t strictly quantitative. Temperature and humidity levels are
quantitative, while descriptors like “hot and humid” are qualitative. The price a
customer paid for a product is quantitative; whether they like or dislike it is
qualitative. Survey feedback, customer support inquiries, and social media posts
are qualitative. There are whole professions that deal with qualitative data. In a
data analysis context, we usually try to quantify the qualitative. One technique
for this is to extract keywords or phrases and count their occurrences. We’ll look

## Page 38

at this in more detail when we delve into text analysis in Chapter 5. Another
technique is sentiment analysis, in which the structure of language is used to
interpret the meaning of the words used, in addition to their frequency. Sentences
or other bodies of text can be scored for their level of positivity or negativity,
and then counts or averages are used to derive insights that would be hard to
summarize otherwise. There have been exciting advances in the field of natural
language processing, or NLP, though much of this work is done with tools such
as Python.
First-, Second-, and Third-Party Data
First-party data is collected by the organization itself. This can be done through
server logs, databases that keep track of transactions and customer information,
or other systems that are built and controlled by the organization and generate
data of interest for analysis. Since the systems were created in-house, finding the
people who built them and learning about how the data is generated is usually
possible. Data analysts may also be able to influence or have control over how
certain pieces of data are created and stored, particularly when bugs are
responsible for poor data quality.
Second-party data comes from vendors that provide a service or perform a
business function on the organization’s behalf. These are often software as a
service (SaaS) products; common examples are CRM, email and marketing
automation tools, ecommerce-enabling software, and web and mobile interaction
trackers. The data is similar to first-party data since it is about the organization
itself, created by its employees and customers. However, both the code that
generates and stores the data and the data model are controlled externally, and
the data analyst typically has little influence over these aspects. Second-party
data is increasingly imported into an organization’s data warehouse for analysis.
This can be accomplished with custom code or ETL connectors, or with SaaS
vendors that offer data integration.
TIP
Many SaaS vendors provide some reporting capabilities, so the question may arise of whether
to bother copying the data to a data warehouse. The department that interacts with a tool may
find that reporting sufficient, such as a customer service department that reports on time to
resolve issues and agent productivity from within its helpdesk software. On the other hand,

## Page 39

customer service interactions might be an important input to a customer retention model,
which would require integrating that data into a data store with sales and cancellation data.
Here’s a good rule of thumb when deciding whether to import data from a particular data
source: if the data will create value when combined with data from other systems, import it; if
not, wait until there is a stronger case before doing the work.
Third-party data may be purchased or obtained from free sources such as those
published by governments. Unless the data has been collected specifically on
behalf of the organization, data teams usually have little control over the format,
frequency, and data quality. This data often lacks the granularity of first- and
second-party data. For example, most third-party sources do not have user-level
data, and instead data might be joined with first-party data at the postal code or
city level, or at a higher level. Third-party data can have unique and useful
information, however, such as aggregate spending patterns, demographics, and
market trends that would be very expensive or impossible to collect otherwise.
Sparse Data
Sparse data occurs when there is a small amount of information within a larger
set of empty or unimportant information. Sparse data might show up as many
nulls and only a few values in a particular column. Null, different from a value
of 0, is the absence of data; that will be covered later in the section on data
cleaning. Sparse data can occur when events are rare, such as software errors or
purchases of products in the long tail of a product catalog. It can also occur in
the early days of a feature or product launch, when only testers or beta customers
have access. JSON is one approach that has been developed to deal with sparse
data from a writing and storage perspective, as it stores only the data that is
present and omits the rest. This is in contrast to a row-store database, which has
to hold memory for a field even if there is no value in it.
Sparse data can be problematic for analysis. When events are rare, trends aren’t
necessarily meaningful, and correlations are hard to distinguish from chance
fluctuations. It’s worth profiling your data, as discussed later in this chapter, to
understand if and where your data is sparse. Some options are to group
infrequent events or items into categories that are more common, exclude the
sparse data or time period from the analysis entirely, or show descriptive
statistics along with cautionary explanations that the trends are not necessarily

## Page 40

meaningful.
There are a number of different types of data and a variety of ways that data is
described, many of which are overlapping or not mutually exclusive. Familiarity
with these types is useful not only in writing good SQL but also for deciding
how to analyze the data in appropriate ways. You may not always know the data
types in advance, which is why data profiling is so critical. Before we get to that,
and to our first code examples, I’ll give a brief review of SQL query structure.
SQL Query Structure
SQL queries have common clauses and syntax, although these can be combined
in a nearly infinite number of ways to achieve analysis goals. This book assumes
you have some prior knowledge of SQL, but I’ll review the basics here so that
we have a common foundation for the code examples to come.
The SELECT clause determines the columns that will be returned by the query.
One column will be returned for each expression within the SELECT clause, and
expressions are separated by commas. An expression can be a field from the
table, an aggregation such as a sum, or any number of calculations, such as
CASE statements, type conversions, and various functions that will be discussed
later in this chapter and throughout the book.
The FROM clause determines the tables from which the expressions in the
SELECT clause are derived. A “table” can be a database table, a view (a type of
saved query that otherwise functions like a table), or a subquery. A subquery is
itself a query, wrapped in parentheses, and the result is treated like any other
table by the query that references it. A query can reference multiple tables in the
FROM clause, though they must use one of the JOIN types along with a
condition that specifies how the tables relate. The JOIN condition usually
specifies an equality between fields in each table, such as
orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id. JOIN conditions
can include multiple fields and can also specify inequalities or ranges of values,
such as ranges of dates. We’ll see a variety of JOIN conditions that achieve
specific analysis goals throughout the book. An INNER JOIN returns all records
that match in both tables. A LEFT JOIN returns all records from the first table,
but only those records from the second table that match. A RIGHT JOIN returns

## Page 41

all records from the second table, but only those records from the first table that
match. A FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records from both tables. A Cartesian
JOIN can result when each record in the first table matches more than one record
in the second table. Cartesian JOINs should generally be avoided, though there
are some specific use cases, such as generating data to fill in a time series, in
which we will use them intentionally. Finally, tables in the FROM clause can be
aliased, or given a shorter name of one or more letters that can be referenced in
other clauses in the query. Aliases save query writers from having to type out
long table names repeatedly, and they make queries easier to read.
TIP
While both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN can be used in the same query, it’s much easier to
keep track of your logic when you stick with only one or the other. In practice, LEFT JOIN is
much more commonly used than RIGHT JOIN.
The WHERE clause specifies restrictions or filters that are needed to exclude or
remove rows from the result set. WHERE is optional.
The GROUP BY clause is required when the SELECT clause contains
aggregations and at least one nonaggregated field. An easy way to remember
what should go in the GROUP BY clause is that it should have every field that is
not part of an aggregation. In most databases, there are two ways to list the
GROUP BY fields: either by field name or by position, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on.
Some people prefer to use the field name notation, and SQL Server requires this.
I prefer the position notation, particularly when the GROUP BY fields contain
complex expressions or when I’m doing a lot of iteration. This book will
typically use the position notation.
HOW NOT TO KILL YOUR DATABASE: LIMIT AND
SAMPLING
Database tables can be very large, containing millions or billions of records.
Querying across all of these records can cause problems at the least and
crash databases at the worst. To avoid receiving cranky calls from database
administrators or getting locked out, it’s a good idea to limit the results

## Page 42

returned during profiling or while testing queries. LIMIT clauses and
sampling are two techniques that should be part of your toolbox.
LIMIT is added as the last line of the query, or subquery, and can take any
positive integer value:
SELECT column_a, column_b
FROM table
LIMIT 1000
;
When used in a subquery, the limit will be applied at that step, and only the
restricted result set will be evaluated by the outer query:
SELECT...
FROM
(
      SELECT column_a, column_b, sum(sales) as total_sales
      FROM table
      GROUP BY 1,2
      LIMIT 1000
) a
;
SQL Server does not support the LIMIT clause, but a similar result can be
obtained using top:
SELECT top 1000
column_a, column_b
FROM table
;
Sampling can be accomplished by using a function on an ID field that has a
random distribution of digits at the beginning or end. The modulus or mod
function returns the remainder when one integer is divided by another. If the
ID field is an integer, mod can be used to find the last one, two, or more
digits and filter on the result:
WHERE mod(integer_order_id,100) = 6
This will return every order whose last two digits are 06, which should be

## Page 43

about 1% of the total. If the field is alphanumeric, you can use a right()
function to find a certain number of digits at the end:
WHERE right(alphanum_order_id,1) = 'B'
This will return every order with a last digit of B, which will be about 3% of
the total if all letters and numbers are equally common, an assumption worth
validating.
Limiting the result set also makes your work faster, but be aware that subsets
of data might not contain all of the variations in values and edge cases that
exist in the full data set. Remember to remove the LIMIT or sampling before
running your final analysis or report with your query, or you’ll end up with
funny results!
That covers the basics of SQL query structure. Chapter 8 will go into additional
detail on each of these clauses, a few additional ones that are less commonly
encountered but appear in this book, and the order in which each clause is
evaluated. Now that we have this foundation, we can turn to one of the most
important parts of the analysis process: data profiling.
Profiling: Distributions
Profiling is the first thing I do when I start working with any new data set. I look
at how the data is arranged into schemas and tables. I look at the table names to
get familiar with the topics covered, such as customers, orders, or visits. I check
out the column names in a few tables and start to construct a mental model of
how the tables relate to one another. For example, the tables might include an
order_detail table with line-item breakouts that relate to the order table
via an order_id, while the order table relates to the customer table via a
customer_id. If there is a data dictionary, I review that and compare it to the
data I see in a sample of rows.
The tables generally represent the operations of an organization, or some subset
of the operations, so I think about what domain or domains are covered, such as
ecommerce, marketing, or product interactions. Working with data is easier

## Page 44

when we have knowledge of how the data was generated. Profiling can provide
clues about this, or about what questions to ask of the source, or of people inside
or outside the organization responsible for the collection or generation of the
data. Even when you collect the data yourself, profiling is useful.
Another detail I check for is how history is represented, if at all. Data sets that
are replicas of production databases may not contain previous values for
customer addresses or order statuses, for example, whereas a well-constructed
data warehouse may have daily snapshots of changing data fields.
Profiling data is related to the concept of exploratory data analysis, or EDA,
named by John Tukey. In his book of that name,  Tukey describes how to
analyze data sets by computing various summaries and visualizing the results.
He includes techniques for looking at distributions of data, including stem-and-
leaf plots, box plots, and histograms.
After checking a few samples of data, I start looking at distributions.
Distributions allow me to understand the range of values that exist in the data
and how often they occur, whether there are nulls, and whether negative values
exist alongside positive ones. Distributions can be created with continuous or
categorical data and are also called frequencies. In this section, we’ll look at how
to create histograms, how binning can help us understand the distribution of
continuous values, and how to use n-tiles to get more precise about distributions.
Histograms and Frequencies
One of the best ways to get to know a data set, and to know particular fields
within the data set, is to check the frequency of values in each field. Frequency
checks are also useful whenever you have a question about whether certain
values are possible or if you spot an unexpected value and want to know how
commonly it occurs. Frequency checks can be done on any data type, including
strings, numerics, dates, and booleans. Frequency queries are a great way to
detect sparse data as well.
The query is straightforward. The number of rows can be found with
count(*), and the profiled field is in the GROUP BY. For example, we can
check the frequency of each type of fruit in a fictional fruit_inventory
table:

## Page 45

SELECT fruit, count(*) as quantity
FROM fruit_inventory
GROUP BY 1
;
TIP
When using count, it’s worth taking a minute to consider whether there might be any
duplicate records in the data set. You can use count(*) when you want the number of
records, but use count distinct to find out how many unique items there are.
A frequency plot is a way to visualize the number of times something occurs in
the data set. The field being profiled is usually plotted on the x-axis, with the
count of observations on the y-axis. Figure 2-1 shows an example of plotting the
frequency of fruit from our query. Frequency graphs can also be drawn
horizontally, which accommodates long value names well. Notice that this is
categorical data without any inherent order.

## Page 46

Figure 2-1. Frequency plot of fruit inventory
A histogram is a way to visualize the distribution of numerical values in a data
set and will be familiar to those with a statistics background. A basic histogram
might show the distribution of ages across a group of customers. Imagine that we
have a customers table that contains names, registration date, age, and other
attributes. To create a histogram by age, GROUP BY the numerical age field
and count customer_id:
SELECT age, count(customer_id) as customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY 1

## Page 47

;
The results of our hypothetical age distribution are graphed in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2. Customers by age
Another technique I’ve used repeatedly and that has become the basis for one of
my favorite interview questions involves an aggregation followed by a frequency
count. I give candidates a hypothetical table called orders, which has a date,
customer identifier, order identifier, and an amount, and then ask them to write a
SQL query that returns the distribution of orders per customer. This can’t be
solved with a simple query; it requires an intermediate aggregation step, which
can be accomplished with a subquery. First, count the number of orders placed
by each customer_id in the subquery. The outer query uses the number of
orders as a category and counts the number of customers:

## Page 48

SELECT orders, count(*) as num_customers
FROM
(
    SELECT customer_id, count(order_id) as orders
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY 1
) a
GROUP BY 1
;
This type of profiling can be applied whenever you need to see how frequently
certain entities or attributes appear in the data. In these examples, count has
been used, but the other basic aggregations (sum, avg, min, and max) can be
used to create histograms as well. For instance, we might want to profile
customers by the sum of all their orders, their avg order size, their min order
date, or their max (most recent) order date.
Binning
Binning is useful when working with continuous values. Rather than the number
of observations or records for each value being counted, ranges of values are
grouped together, and these groups are called bins or buckets. The number of
records that fall into each interval is then counted. Bins can be variable in size or
have a fixed size, depending on whether your goal is to group the data into bins
that have particular meaning for the organization, are roughly equal width, or
contain roughly equal numbers of records. Bins can be created with CASE
statements, rounding, and logarithms.
A CASE statement allows for conditional logic to be evaluated. These statements
are very flexible, and we will come back to them throughout the book, applying
them to data profiling, cleaning, text analysis, and more. The basic structure of a
CASE statement is:
case when condition1 then return_value_1
     when condition2 then return_value_2
     ...
     else return_value_default
     end
The WHEN condition can be an equality, inequality, or other logical condition.

## Page 49

The THEN return value can be a constant, an expression, or a field in the table.
Any number of conditions can be included, but the statement will stop executing
and return the result the first time a condition evaluates to TRUE. ELSE tells the
database what to use as a default value if no matches are found and can also be a
constant or field. ELSE is optional, and if it is not included, any nonmatches will
return null. CASE statements can also be nested so that the return value is
another CASE statement.
TIP
The return values following THEN must all be the same data type (strings, numeric,
BOOLEAN, etc.), or else you’ll get an error. Consider casting to a common data type such as
string if you encounter this.
A CASE statement is a flexible way to control the number of bins, the range of
values that fall into each bin, and how the bins are named. I find them
particularly useful when there is a long tail of very small or very large values
that I want to group together rather than have empty bins in part of the
distribution. Certain ranges of values have a business meaning that needs to be
re-created in the data. Many B2B companies separate their customers into
“enterprise” and “SMB” (small- and medium-sized businesses) categories based
on number of employees or revenue, because their buying patterns are different.
As an example, imagine we are considering discounted shipping offers and we
want to know how many customers will be affected. We can group
order_amount into three buckets using a CASE statement:
SELECT 
case when order_amount <= 100 then 'up to 100'
     when order_amount <= 500 then '100 - 500'
     else '500+' end as amount_bin
,case when order_amount <= 100 then 'small'
      when order_amount <= 500 then 'medium'
      else 'large' end as amount_category
,count(customer_id) as customers
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1,2
;

## Page 50

Arbitrary-sized bins can be useful, but at other times bins of fixed size are more
appropriate for the analysis. Fixed-size bins can be accomplished in a few ways,
including with rounding, logarithms, and n-tiles. To create equal-width bins,
rounding is useful. Rounding reduces the precision of the values, and we usually
think about rounding as reducing the number of decimal places or removing
them altogether by rounding to the nearest integer. The round function takes
the form:
round(value,number_of_decimal_places)
The number of decimal places can also be a negative number, allowing this
function to round to the nearest tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on. Table 2-2
demonstrates the results of rounding with arguments ranging from –3 to 2.
Table 2-2. The number 123,456.789 rounded with 
various decimal places

-3
round(123456.789,-3) 123000
SELECT round(sales,-1) as bin
,count(customer_id) as customers
FROM table
GROUP BY 1
;
Logarithms are another way to create bins, particularly in data sets in which the
largest values are orders of magnitude greater than the smallest values. The
distribution of household wealth, the number of website visitors across different
properties on the internet, and the shaking force of earthquakes are all examples
of phenomena that have this property. While they don’t create bins of equal
width, logarithms create bins that increase in size with a useful pattern. To

## Page 51

refresh your memory, a logarithm is the exponent to which 10 must be raised to
produce that number:
log(number) = exponent
In this case, 10 is called the base, and this is usually the default implementation
in databases, but technically the base can be any number. Table 2-3 shows the
logarithms for several powers of 10.
Table 2-3. Results of log 
function on powers of 10
Formula
Result
log(1)

log(10)

log(100)

log(1000)

log(10000)

In SQL, the log function returns the logarithm of its argument, which can be a
constant or a field:
SELECT log(sales) as bin
,count(customer_id) as customers
FROM table
GROUP BY 1
;
The log function can be used on any positive value, not just multiples of 10.
However, the logarithm function does not work when values can be less than or
equal to 0; it will return null or an error, depending on the database.
n-Tiles
You’re probably familiar with the median, or middle value, of a data set. This is
the 50th percentile value. Half of the values are larger than the median, and the
other half are smaller. With quartiles, we fill in the 25th and 75th percentile
values. A quarter of the values are smaller and three quarters are larger for the

## Page 52

25th percentile; three quarters are smaller and one quarter are larger at the 75th
percentile. Deciles break the data set into 10 equal parts. Making this concept
generic, n-tiles allow us to calculate any percentile of the data set: 27th
percentile, 50.5th percentile, and so on.
WINDOW FUNCTIONS
The n-tiles functions are part of a group of SQL functions called window or
analytic functions. Unlike most SQL functions, which can operate only on
the current row of data, window functions perform calculations that span
multiple rows. Window functions have special syntax that includes the
function name and an OVER clause that is used to determine the rows on
which to operate and the ordering of those rows. The general format of a
window function is:
function(field_name) over (partition by field_name order by 
field_name)
The function can be any of the normal aggregations (count, sum, avg,
min, max) as well as a number of special functions, including rank,
first_value, and ntile. The PARTITION BY clause can include zero
or more fields. When no fields are specified, the function operates over the
entire table, but when one or more fields are specified, the function will
operate only on that section of rows. For example, we might PARTITION BY
a customer_id to perform calculations about all of the records per
customer, restarting the calculation for each customer. The ORDER BY
clause determines the ordering of the rows for functions that rely on this; for
example, to rank customers, we need to specify a field by which to order
them, such as number of orders. All of the major database types have
window functions, except for versions of MySQL prior to 8.0.2. We will see
these useful functions throughout the book, along with additional
explanations of how they work and how to set up the arguments correctly.
Many databases have a median function built in but rely on more generic n-tile
functions for the rest. These functions are window functions, computing across a
range of rows to return a value for a single row. They take an argument that

## Page 53

specifies the number of bins to split the data into and, optionally, a PARTITION
BY and/or an ORDER BY clause:
ntile(num_bins) over (partition by... order by...)
As an example, imagine we had 12 transactions with order_amounts of
$19.99, $9.99, $59.99, $11.99, $23.49, $55.98, $12.99, $99.99, $14.99, $34.99,
$4.99, and $89.99. Performing an ntile calculation with 10 bins sorts each
order_amount and assigns a bin from 1 to 10:
order_amount  ntile
------------  -----
4.99          1
9.99          1
11.99         2
12.99         2
14.99         3
19.99         4
23.49         5
34.99         6
55.98         7
59.99         8
89.99         9
99.99         10
This can be used to bin records in practice by first calculating the ntile of
each row in a subquery and then wrapping it in an outer query that uses min and
max to find the upper and lower boundaries of the value range:
SELECT ntile
,min(order_amount) as lower_bound
,max(order_amount) as upper_bound
,count(order_id) as orders
FROM
(
    SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_amount
    ,ntile(10) over (order by order_amount) as ntile
    FROM orders
) a
GROUP BY 1
;
A related function is percent_rank. Instead of returning the bins that the data

## Page 54

falls into, percent_rank returns the percentile. It takes no argument but
requires parentheses and optionally takes a PARTITION BY and/or an ORDER
BY clause:
percent_rank() over (partition by... order by...)
While not as useful as ntile for binning, percent_rank can be used to
create a continuous distribution, or it can be used as an output itself for reporting
or further analysis. Both ntile and percent_rank can be expensive to
compute over large data sets, since they require sorting all the rows. Filtering the
table to only the data set you need helps. Some databases have implemented
approximate versions of the functions that are faster to compute and generally
return high-quality results if absolute precision is not required. We will look at
additional uses for n-tiles in the discussion of anomaly detection in Chapter 6.
In many contexts, there is no single correct or objectively best way to look at
distributions of data. There is significant leeway for analysts to use the preceding
techniques to understand data and present it to others. However, data scientists
need to use judgment and must bring their ethical radar along whenever sharing
distributions of sensitive data.
Profiling: Data Quality
Data quality is absolutely critical when it comes to creating good analysis.
Although this may seem obvious, it has been one of the hardest lessons I’ve
learned in my years of working with data. It’s easy to get overly focused on the
mechanics of processing the data, finding clever query techniques and just the
right visualization, only to have stakeholders ignore all of that and point out the
one data inconsistency. Ensuring data quality can be one of the hardest and most
frustrating parts of analysis. The saying “garbage in, garbage out” captures only
part of the problem. Good ingredients in plus incorrect assumptions can also lead
to garbage out.
Comparing data against ground truth, or what is otherwise known to be true, is
ideal though not always possible. For example, if you are working with a replica
of a production database, you could compare the row counts in each system to
verify that all rows arrived in the replica database. In other cases, you might

## Page 55

know the dollar value and count of sales in a particular month and thus can
query for this information in the database to make sure the sum of sales and
count of records match. Often the difference between your query results and
the expected value comes down to whether you applied the correct filters, such
as excluding cancelled orders or test accounts; how you handled nulls and
spelling anomalies; and whether you set up correct JOIN conditions between
tables.
Profiling is a way to uncover data quality issues early on, before they negatively
impact results and conclusions drawn from the data. Profiling reveals nulls,
categorical codings that need to be deciphered, fields with multiple values that
need to be parsed, and unusual datetime formats. Profiling can also uncover gaps
and step changes in the data that have resulted from tracking changes or outages.
Data is rarely perfect, and it’s often only through its use in analysis that data
quality issues are uncovered.
Detecting Duplicates
A duplicate is when you have two (or more) rows with the same information.
Duplicates can exist for any number of reasons. A mistake might have been
made during data entry, if there is some manual step. A tracking call might have
fired twice. A processing step might have run multiple times. You might have
created it accidentally with a hidden many-to-many JOIN. However they come
to be, duplicates can really throw a wrench in your analysis. I can recall times
early in my career when I thought I had a great finding, only to have a product
manager point out that my sales figure was twice the actual sales. It’s
embarrassing, it erodes trust, and it requires rework and sometimes painstaking
reviews of the code to find the problem. I’ve learned to check for duplicates as I
go.
Fortunately, it’s relatively easy to find duplicates in our data. One way is to
inspect a sample, with all columns ordered:
SELECT column_a, column_b, column_c...
FROM table
ORDER BY 1,2,3...
;

## Page 56

This will reveal whether the data is full of duplicates, for example, when looking
at a brand-new data set, when you suspect that a process is generating duplicates,
or after a possible Cartesian JOIN. If there are only a few duplicates, they might
not show up in the sample. And scrolling through data to try to spot duplicates is
taxing on your eyes and brain. A more systematic way to find duplicates is to
SELECT the columns and then count the rows (this might look familiar from
the discussion of histograms!):
SELECT count(*)
FROM
(
    SELECT column_a, column_b, column_c...
    , count(*) as records
    FROM...
    GROUP BY 1,2,3...
) a
WHERE records > 1
;
This will tell you whether there are any cases of duplicates. If the query returns
0, you’re good to go. For more detail, you can list out the number of records (2,
3, 4, etc.):
SELECT records, count(*)
FROM
(
    SELECT column_a, column_b, column_c..., count(*) as records
    FROM...
    GROUP BY 1,2,3...
) a
WHERE records > 1
GROUP BY 1
;
NOTE
As an alternative to a subquery, you can use a HAVING clause and keep everything in a single
main query. Since it is evaluated after the aggregation and GROUP BY, HAVING can be used
to filter on the aggregation value:
SELECT column_a, column_b, column_c..., count(*) as records
FROM...
GROUP BY 1,2,3...

## Page 57

HAVING count(*) > 1
;
I prefer to use subqueries, because I find that they’re a useful way to organize my logic.
Chapter 8 will discuss order of evaluation and strategies for keeping your SQL queries
organized.
For full detail on which records have duplicates, you can list out all the fields
and then use this information to chase down which records are problematic:
SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT column_a, column_b, column_c..., count(*) as records
    FROM...
    GROUP BY 1,2,3...
) a
WHERE records = 2
;
Detecting duplicates is one thing; figuring out what to do about them is another.
It’s almost always useful to understand why duplicates are occurring and, if
possible, fix the problem upstream. Can a data process be improved to reduce or
remove duplication? Is there an error in an ETL process? Have you failed to
account for a one-to-many relationship in a JOIN? Next, we’ll turn to some
options for handling and removing duplicates with SQL.
Deduplication with GROUP BY and DISTINCT
Duplicates happen, and they’re not always a result of bad data. For example,
imagine we want to find a list of all the customers who have successfully
completed a transaction so we can send them a coupon for their next order. We
might JOIN the customers table to the transactions table, which would
restrict the records returned to only those customers that appear in the
transactions table:
SELECT a.customer_id, a.customer_name, a.customer_email
FROM customers a
JOIN transactions b on a.customer_id = b.customer_id
;

## Page 58

This will return a row for each customer for each transaction, however, and there
are hopefully at least a few customers who have transacted more than once. We
have accidentally created duplicates, not because there is any underlying data
quality problem but because we haven’t taken care to avoid duplication in the
results. Fortunately, there are several ways to avoid this with SQL. One way to
remove duplicates is to use the keyword DISTINCT:
SELECT distinct a.customer_id, a.customer_name, a.customer_email
FROM customers a
JOIN transactions b on a.customer_id = b.customer_id
;
Another option is to use a GROUP BY, which, although typically seen in
connection with an aggregation, will also deduplicate in the same way as
DISTINCT. I remember the first time I saw a colleague use GROUP BY without
an aggregation dedupe—I didn’t even realize it was possible. I find it somewhat
less intuitive than DISTINCT, but the result is the same:
SELECT a.customer_id, a.customer_name, a.customer_email
FROM customers a
JOIN transactions b on a.customer_id = b.customer_id
GROUP BY 1,2,3
;
Another useful technique is to perform an aggregation that returns one row per
entity. Although technically not deduping, it has a similar effect. For example, if
we have a number of transactions by the same customer and need to return one
record per customer, we could find the min (first) and/or the max (most recent)
transaction_date:
SELECT customer_id
,min(transaction_date) as first_transaction_date
,max(transaction_date) as last_transaction_date
,count(*) as total_orders
FROM table
GROUP BY customer_id
;
Duplicate data, or data that contains multiple records per entity even if they
technically are not duplicates, is one of the most common reasons for incorrect

## Page 59

query results. You can suspect duplicates as the cause if all of a sudden the
number of customers or total sales returned by a query is many times greater
than what you were expecting. Fortunately, there are several techniques that can
be applied to prevent this from occurring.
Another common problem is missing data, which we’ll turn to next.
Preparing: Data Cleaning
Profiling often reveals where changes can make the data more useful for
analysis.  Some of the steps are CASE transformations, adjusting for null, and
changing data types.
Cleaning Data with CASE Transformations
CASE statements can be used to perform a variety of cleaning, enrichment, and
summarization tasks. Sometimes the data exists and is accurate, but it would be
more useful for analysis if values were standardized or grouped into categories.
The structure of CASE statements was presented earlier in this chapter, in the
section on binning.
Nonstandard values occur for a variety of reasons. Values might come from
different systems with slightly different lists of choices, system code might have
changed, options might have been presented to the customer in different
languages, or the customer might have been able to fill out the value rather than
pick from a list.
Imagine a field containing information about the gender of a person. Values
indicating a female person exist as “F,” “female,” and “femme.” We can
standardize the values like this:
CASE when gender = 'F' then 'Female'
     when gender = 'female' then 'Female'
     when gender = 'femme' then 'Female'
     else gender 
     end as gender_cleaned
CASE statements can also be used to add categorization or enrichment that does
not exist in the original data. As an example, many organizations use a Net

## Page 60

Promoter Score, or NPS, to monitor customer sentiment. NPS surveys ask
respondents to rate, on a scale of 0 to 10, how likely they are to recommend a
company or product to a friend or colleague. Scores of 0 to 6 are considered
detractors, 7 and 8 are passive, and 9 and 10 are promoters. The final score is
calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of
promoters. Survey result data sets usually include optional free text comments
and are sometimes enriched with information the organization knows about the
person surveyed. Given a data set of NPS survey responses, the first step is to
group the responses into the categories of detractor, passive, and promoter:
SELECT response_id
,likelihood
,case when likelihood <= 6 then 'Detractor'
      when likelihood <= 8 then 'Passive'
      else 'Promoter'
     end as response_type
FROM nps_responses
;
Note that the data type can differ between the field being evaluated and the
return data type. In this case, we are checking an integer and returning a string.
Listing out all the values with an IN list is also an option. The IN operator allows
you to specify a list of items rather than having to write an equality for each one
separately. It is useful when the input isn’t continuous or when values in order
shouldn’t be grouped together:
case when likelihood in (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) then 'Detractor'
     when likelihood in (7,8) then 'Passive'
     when likelihood in (9,10) then 'Promoter'
     end as response_type
CASE statements can consider multiple columns and can contain AND/OR
logic. They can also be nested, though often this can be avoided with AND/OR
logic:
case when likelihood <= 6 
          and country = 'US' 
          and high_value = true 
          then 'US high value detractor'
     when likelihood >= 9 
          and (country in ('CA','JP')

## Page 61

or high_value = true
              ) 
          then 'some other label'
     ... end
ALTERNATIVES FOR CLEANING DATA
Cleaning or enriching data with a CASE statement  works well as long as
there is a relatively short list of variations, you can find them all in the data,
and the list of values isn’t expected to change. For longer lists and ones that
change frequently, a lookup table can be a better option. A lookup table
exists in the database and is either static or populated with code that checks
for new values periodically. The query will JOIN to the lookup table to get
the cleaned data. In this way, the cleaned values can be maintained outside
your code and used by many queries, without your having to worry about
maintaining consistency between them. An example of this might be a
lookup table that maps state abbreviations to full state names. In my own
work, I often start with a CASE statement and create a lookup table only
after the list becomes unruly, or once it’s clear that my team or I will need to
use this cleaning step repeatedly.
Of course, it’s worth investigating whether the data can be cleaned upstream.
I once started with a CASE statement of 5 or so lines that grew to 10 lines
and then eventually to more than 100 lines, at which point the list was unruly
and difficult to maintain. The insights were valuable enough that I was able
to convince engineers to change the tracking code and send the meaningful
categorizations in the data stream in the first place.
Another useful thing you can do with CASE statements is to create flags
indicating whether a certain value is present, without returning the actual value.
This can be useful during profiling for understanding how common the existence
of a particular attribute is. Another use for flagging is during preparation of a
data set for statistical analysis. In this case, a flag is also known as a dummy
variable, taking a value of 0 or 1 and indicating the presence or absence of some
qualitative variable. For example, we can create is_female and
is_promoter flags with CASE statements on gender and likelihood (to
recommend) fields:

## Page 62

SELECT customer_id
,case when gender = 'F' then 1 else 0 end as is_female
,case when likelihood in (9,10) then 1 else 0 end as is_promoter
FROM ...
;
If you are working with a data set that has multiple rows per entity, such as with
line items in an order, you can flatten the data with a CASE statement wrapped
in an aggregate and turn it into a flag at the same time by using 1 and 0 as the
return value. We saw previously that a BOOLEAN data type is often used to
create flags (fields that represent the presence or absence of some attribute).
Here, 1 is substituted for TRUE and 0 is substituted for FALSE so that a max
aggregation can be applied. The way this works is that for each customer, the
CASE statement returns 1 for any row with a fruit type of “apple.” Then max is
evaluated and will return the largest value from any of the rows. As long as a
customer bought an apple at least once, the flag will be 1; if not, it will be 0:
SELECT customer_id
,max(case when fruit = 'apple' then 1 
          else 0 
          end) as bought_apples
,max(case when fruit = 'orange' then 1 
          else 0 
          end) as bought_oranges
FROM ...
GROUP BY 1
;
You can also construct more complex conditions for flags, such as requiring a
threshold or amount of something before labeling with a value of 1:
SELECT customer_id
,max(case when fruit = 'apple' and quantity > 5 then 1 
          else 0 
          end) as loves_apples
,max(case when fruit = 'orange' and quantity > 5 then 1 
          else 0 
          end) as loves_oranges
FROM ...
GROUP BY 1
;

## Page 63

CASE statements are powerful, and as we saw, they can be used to clean, enrich,
and flag or add dummy variables to data sets. In the next section, we’ll look at
some special functions related to CASE statements that handle null values
specifically.
Type Conversions and Casting
Every field in a database is defined with a data type, which we reviewed at the
beginning of this chapter. When data is inserted into a table, values that aren’t of
the field’s type are rejected by the database. Strings can’t be inserted into integer
fields, and booleans are not allowed in date fields. Most of the time, we can take
the data types for granted and apply string functions to strings, date functions to
dates, and so on. Occasionally, however, we need to override the data type of the
field and force it to be something else. This is where type conversions and
casting come in.
Type conversion functions allow pieces of data with the appropriate format to be
changed from one data type to another. The syntax comes in a few forms that are
basically equivalent. One way to change the data type is with the cast function,
cast (input as data_type), or two colons, input :: data_type.
Both of these are equivalent and convert the integer 1,234 to a string:
cast (1234 as varchar)
1234::varchar
Converting an integer to a string can be useful in CASE statements when
categorizing numeric values with some unbounded upper or lower value. For
example, in the following code, leaving the values that are less than or equal to 3
as integers while returning the string “4+” for higher values would result in an
error:
case when order_items <= 3 then order_items
     else '4+' 
     end
Casting the integers to the VARCHAR type solves the problem:

## Page 64

case when order_items <= 3 then order_items::varchar
     else '4+' 
     end
Type conversions also come in handy when values that should be integers are
parsed out of a string, and then we want to aggregate the values or use
mathematical functions on them. Imagine we have a data set of prices, but the
values include the dollar sign ($), and so the data type of the field is
VARCHAR.  We can remove the $ character with a function called replace,
which will be discussed more during our look at text analysis in Chapter 5:
SELECT replace('$19.99','$','');
replace
-------
9.99
The result is still a VARCHAR, however, so trying to apply an aggregation will
return an error. To fix this, we can cast the result as a FLOAT:
replace('$19.99','$','')::float
cast(replace('$19.99','$','')) as float
Dates and datetimes can come in a bewildering array of formats, and
understanding how to cast them to the desired format is useful. I’ll show a few
examples on type conversion here, and Chapter 3 will go into more detail on
date and datetime calculations. As a simple example, imagine that transaction or
event data often arrives in the database as a TIMESTAMP, but we want to
summarize some value such as transactions by day. Simply grouping by the
timestamp will result in more rows than necessary. Casting the TIMESTAMP to
a DATE reduces the size of the results and achieves our summarization goal:
SELECT tx_timestamp::date, count(transactions) as num_transactions
FROM ...
GROUP BY 1
;
Likewise, a DATE can be cast to a TIMESTAMP when a SQL function requires
a TIMESTAMP argument. Sometimes the year, month, and day are stored in
separate columns, or they end up as separate elements because they’ve been

## Page 65

parsed out of a longer string. These then need to be assembled back into a date.
To do this, we use the concatenation operator || (double pipe) or concat
function and then cast the result to a DATE. Any of these syntaxes works and
returns the same value:
(year || ',' || month|| '-' || day)::date
Or equivalently:
cast(concat(year, '-', month, '-', day) as date)
Yet another way to convert between string values and dates is by using the date
function. For example, we can construct a string value as above and convert it
into a date:
date(concat(year, '-', month, '-', day))
The to_datatype functions can take both a value and a format string and thus
give you more control over how the data is converted. Table 2-4 summarizes the
functions and their purposes. They are particularly useful when converting in
and out of DATE or DATETIME formats, as they allow you to specify the order
of the date and time elements.
Table 2-4. The to_datatype functions
Function
Purpose
to_char
Converts other types to string
to_number
Converts other types to numeric
to_date
Converts other types to date, with specified date parts
to_timestamp
Converts other types to date, with specified date and time parts
Sometimes the database automatically converts a data type. This is called type
coercion. For example, INT and FLOAT numerics can usually be used together
in mathematical functions or aggregations without explicitly changing the type.
CHAR and VARCHAR values can usually be mixed. Some databases will
coerce BOOLEAN fields to 0 and 1 values, where 0 is FALSE and 1 is TRUE,

## Page 66

but some databases require you to convert the values explicitly. Some databases
are pickier than others about mixing dates and datetimes in result sets and
functions. You can read through the documentation, or you can do some simple
query experiments to learn how the database you’re working with handles data
types implicitly and explicitly. There is usually a way to accomplish what you
want, though sometimes you need to get creative in using functions in your
queries.
Dealing with Nulls: coalesce, nullif, nvl Functions
Null was one of the stranger concepts I had to get used to when I started working
with data. Null just isn’t something we think about in daily life, where we’re
used to dealing in concrete quantities of things. Null has a special meaning in
databases and was introduced by Edgar Codd, the inventor of the relational
database, to ensure that databases have a way to represent missing information.
If someone asks me how many parachutes I have, I can answer “zero.” But if the
question is never asked, I have null parachutes.
Nulls can represent fields for which no data was collected or that aren’t
applicable for that row. When new columns are added to a table, the values for
previously created rows will be null unless explicitly filled with some other
value. When two tables are joined via an OUTER JOIN, nulls will appear in any
fields for which there is no matching record in the second table.
Nulls are problematic for certain aggregations and groupings, and different types
of databases handle them in different ways. For example, imagine I have five
records, with 5, 10, 15, 20, and null. The sum of these is 50, but the average is
either 10 or 12.5 depending on whether the null value is counted in the
denominator. The whole question may also be considered invalid since one of
the values is null. For most database functions, a null input will return a null
output. Equalities and inequalities involving null also return null. A variety of
unexpected and frustrating results can be output from your queries if you are not
on the lookout for nulls.
When tables are defined, they can either allow nulls, reject nulls, or populate a
default value if the field would otherwise be left null. In practice, this means that
you can’t always rely on a field to show up as null if the data is missing, because
it may have been filled with a default value such as 0. I once had a long debate

## Page 67

with a data engineer when it turned out that null dates in the source system were
defaulting to “1970-01-01” in our data warehouse. I insisted that the dates
should be null instead, to reflect the fact that they were unknown or not
applicable. The engineer pointed out that I could remember to filter those dates
or change them back to null with a CASE statement. I finally prevailed by
pointing out that one day another user who wasn’t as aware of the nuances of
default dates would come along, run a query, and get the puzzling cluster of
customers about a year before the company was even founded.
Nulls are often inconvenient or inappropriate for the analysis you want to do.
They can also make output confusing to the intended audience for your analysis.
Businesspeople don’t necessarily understand how to interpret a null value or may
assume that null values represent a problem with data quality.
EMPTY STRINGS
A concept related to but slightly different from nulls is empty string, where
there is no value but the field is not technically null. One reason an empty
string might be used is to indicate that a field is known to be blank, as
opposed to null, where the value might be missing or unknown. For
example, the database might have a name_suffix field that can be used to
hold a value such as “Jr.” Many people do not have a name_suffix, so an
empty string is appropriate. Empty string can also be used as a default value
instead of null, or as a way to overcome a NOT NULL constraint by
inserting a value, even if empty. An empty string can be specified in a query
with two quote marks:
WHERE my_field = '' or my_field <> 'apple'
Profiling the frequencies of values should reveal whether your data includes
nulls, empty strings, or both.
There are a few ways to replace nulls with alternate values: CASE statements,
and the specialized coalesce and nullif functions. We saw previously that
CASE statements can check a condition and return a value. They can also be
used to check for a null and, if one is found, replace it with another value:

## Page 68

case when num_orders is null then 0 else num_orders end
case when address is null then 'Unknown' else address end
case when column_a is null then column_b else column_a end
The coalesce function is a more compact way to achieve this. It takes two or
more arguments and returns the first one that is not null:
coalesce(num_orders,0)
coalesce(address,'Unknown')
coalesce(column_a,column_b)
coalesce(column_a,column_b,column_c)
NOTE
The function nvl exists in some databases and is similar to coalesce, but it allows only two
arguments.
The nullif function compares two numbers, and if they are not equal, it
returns the first number; if they are equal, the function returns null. Running this
code:
nullif(6,7)
returns 6, whereas null is returned by:
nullif(6,6)
nullif is equivalent to the following, more wordy case statement:
case when 6 = 7 then 6 
     when 6 = 6 then null
     end
This function can be useful for turning values back into nulls when you know a
certain default value has been inserted into the database. For example, with my

## Page 69

default time example, we could change it back to null by using:
nullif(date,'1970-01-01')
WARNING
Nulls can be problematic when filtering data in the WHERE clause. Returning values that are
null is fairly straightforward:
WHERE my_field is null
However, imagine that my_field contains some nulls and also some names of fruits. I would
like to return all rows that are not apples. It seems like this should work:
WHERE my_field <> 'apple'
However, some databases will exclude both the “apple” rows and all rows with null values in
my_field. To correct this, the SQL should both filter out “apple” and explicitly include nulls
by connecting the conditions with OR:
WHERE my_field <> 'apple' or my_field is null
Nulls are a fact of life when working with data. Regardless of why they occur,
we often need to consider them in profiling and as targets for data cleaning.
Fortunately, there are a number of ways to detect them with SQL, as well as
several useful functions that allow us to replace nulls with alternate values. Next
we’ll look at missing data, a problem that can cause nulls but has even wider
implications and thus deserves a section of its own.
Missing Data
Data can be missing for a variety of reasons, each with its own implications for
how you decide to handle the data’s absence. A field might not have been
required by the system or process that collected it, as with an optional “how did
you hear about us?” field in an ecommerce checkout flow. Requiring this field
might create friction for the customer and decrease successful checkouts.
Alternatively, data might normally be required but wasn’t collected due to a code

## Page 70

bug or human error, such as in a medical questionnaire where the interviewer
missed the second page of questions. A change in the way the data was collected
can result in records before or after the change having missing values. A tool
tracking mobile app interactions might add an additional field recording whether
the interaction was a tap or a scroll, for example, or remove another field due to
functionality change. Data can be orphaned when a table references a value in
another table, and that row or the entire table has been deleted or is not yet
loaded into the data warehouse. Finally, data may be available but not at the
level of detail, or granularity, needed for the analysis. An example of this comes
from subscription businesses, where customers pay on an annual basis for a
monthly product and we want to analyze monthly revenue.
In addition to profiling the data with histograms and frequency analysis, we can
often detect missing data by comparing values in two tables. For example, we
might expect that each customer in the transactions table also has a record
in the customer table. To check this, query the tables using a LEFT JOIN and
add a WHERE condition to find the customers that do not exist in the second
table:
SELECT distinct a.customer_id
FROM transactions a
LEFT JOIN customers b on a.customer_id = b.customer_id
WHERE b.customer_id is null
;
Missing data can be an important signal in and of itself, so don’t assume that it
always needs to be fixed or filled. Missing data can reveal the underlying system
design or biases in the data collection process.
Records with missing fields can be filtered out entirely, but often we want to
keep them and instead make some adjustments based on what we know about
expected or typical values. We have some options, called imputation techniques,
for filling in missing data. These include filling with an average or median of the
data set, or with the previous value. Documenting the missing data and how it
was replaced is important, as this may impact the downstream interpretation and
use of the data. Imputed values can be particularly problematic when the data is
used in machine learning, for example.
A common option is to fill missing data with a constant value. Filling with a

## Page 71

constant value can be useful when the value is known for some records even
though they were not populated in the database. For example, imagine there was
a software bug that prevented the population of the price for an item called
“xyz,” but we know the price is always $20. A CASE statement can be added to
the query to handle this:
case when price is null and item_name = 'xyz' then 20 
                                              else price 
                                              end as price
Another option is to fill with a derived value, either a mathematical function on
other columns or a CASE statement. For example, imagine we have a field for
the net_sales amount for each transaction. Due to a bug, some rows don’t
have this field populated, but they do have the gross_sales and discount
fields populated. We can calculate net_sales by subtracting discount from
gross_sales:
SELECT gross_sales - discount as net_sales...
Missing values can also be filled with values from other rows in the data set.
Carrying over a value from the previous row is called fill forward, while using a
value from the next row is called fill backward. These can be accomplished with
the lag and lead window functions, respectively. For example, imagine that
our transaction table has a product_price field that stores the undiscounted
price a customer pays for a product. Occasionally this field is not populated,
but we can make an assumption that the price is the same as the price paid by the
last customer to buy that product. We can fill with the previous value using
the lag function, PARTITION BY the product to ensure the price is pulled
only from the same product, and ORDER BY the appropriate date to ensure
the price is pulled from the most recent prior transaction:
lag(product_price) over (partition by product order by order_date)
The lead function could be used to fill with product_price for the
following transaction. Alternatively, we could take the avg of prices for the
product and use that to fill in the missing value. Filling with previous, next, or

## Page 72

average values involves making some assumptions about typical values and
what’s reasonable to include in an analysis. It’s always a good idea to check the
results to make sure they are plausible and to note that you have interpolated the
data when not available.
For data that is available but not at the granularity needed, we often have to
create additional rows in the data set. For example, imagine we have a
customer_subscriptions table with the fields subscription_date
and annual_amount. We can spread this annual subscription amount into 12
equal monthly revenue amounts by dividing by 12, effectively converting ARR
(annual recurring revenue) into MRR (monthly recurring revenue):
SELECT customer_id
,subscription_date
,annual_amount
,annual_amount / 12 as month_1
,annual_amount / 12 as month_2
...
,annual_amount / 12 as month_12
FROM customer_subscriptions
;
This gets a bit tedious, particularly if subscription periods can be two, three, or
five years as well as one year. It’s also not helpful if what we want is the actual
dates of the months. In theory we could write a query like this:
SELECT customer_id
,subscription_date
,annual_amount
,annual_amount / 12 as '2020-01'
,annual_amount / 12 as '2020-02'
...
,annual_amount / 12 as '2020-12'
FROM customer_subscriptions
;
However, if the data includes orders from customers across time, hardcoding the
month names won’t be accurate. We could use CASE statements in combination
with hardcoded month names, but again this is tedious and is likely to be error-
prone as you add more convoluted logic. Instead, creating new rows through a
JOIN to a table such as a date dimension provides an elegant solution.

## Page 73

A date dimension is a static table that has one row per day, with optional
extended date attributes, such as day of the week, month name, end of month,
and fiscal year. The dates extend far enough into the past and far enough into the
future to cover all anticipated uses. Because there are only 365 or 366 days per
year, tables covering even 100 years don’t take up a lot of space. Figure 2-3
shows a sample of the data in a date dimension table. Sample code to create a
date dimension using SQL functions is on the book’s GitHub site.
Figure 2-3. A date dimension table with date attributes
If you’re using a Postgres database, the generate_series function can be
used to create a date dimension either to populate the table initially or if creating
a table is not an option. It takes the following form:
generate_series(start, stop, step interval)

## Page 74

In this function, start is the first date you want in the series, stop is the last
date, and step interval is the time period between values. The step
interval can take any value, but one day is appropriate for a date dimension:
SELECT * 
FROM generate_series('2000-01-01'::timestamp,'2030-12-31', '1 day')
The generate_series function requires at least one of the arguments to be a
TIMESTAMP, so “2000-01-01” is cast as a TIMESTAMP. We can then create a
query that results in a row for every day, regardless of whether a customer
ordered on a particular day. This is useful when we want to ensure that a
customer is counted for each day, or when we specifically want to count or
otherwise analyze days on which a customer did not make a purchase:
SELECT a.generate_series as order_date, b.customer_id, b.items
FROM
(
    SELECT *
    FROM generate_series('2020-01-01'::timestamp,'2020-12-31','1 day')
) a
LEFT JOIN 
(
    SELECT customer_id, order_date, count(item_id) as items
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY 1,2
) b on a.generate_series = b.order_date
;
Returning to our subscription example, we can use the date dimension to create a
record for each month by JOINing the date dimension on dates that are between
the subscription_date and 11 months later (for 12 total months):
SELECT a.date
,b.customer_id
,b.subscription_date
,b.annual_amount / 12 as monthly_subscription
FROM date_dim a
JOIN customer_subscriptions b on a.date between b.subscription_date 
and b.subscription_date + interval '11 months'
;
Data can be missing for various reasons, and understanding the root cause is

## Page 75

important in deciding how to deal with it. There are a number of options for
finding and replacing missing data. These include using CASE statements to set
default values, deriving values by performing calculations on other fields in the
same row, and interpolating from other values in the same column.
Data cleaning is an important part of the data preparation process. Data may
need to be cleaned for many different reasons. Some data cleaning needs to be
done to fix poor data quality, such as when there are inconsistent or missing
values in the raw data, while other data cleaning is done to make further analysis
easier or more meaningful. The flexibility of SQL allows us to perform cleaning
tasks in a variety of ways.
After data is cleaned, a common next step in the preparation process is shaping
the data set. 
Preparing: Shaping Data
Shaping data refers to manipulating the way the data is represented in columns
and rows. Each table in the database has a shape. The result set of each query has
a shape. Shaping data may seem like a rather abstract concept, but if you work
with enough data, you will come to see its value. It is a skill that can be learned,
practiced, and mastered.
One of the most important concepts in shaping data is figuring out the
granularity of data that you need. Just as rocks can range in size from giant
boulders down to grains of sand, and even further down to microscopic dust, so
too can data have varying levels of detail. For example, if the population of a
country is a boulder, then the population of a city is a small rock, and that of a
household is a grain of sand. Data at a smaller level of detail might include
individual births and deaths, or moves from one city or country to another.
Flattening data is another important concept in shaping. This refers to reducing
the number of rows that represent an entity, including down to a single row.
Joining multiple tables together to create a single output data set is one way to
flatten data. Another way is through aggregation.
In this section, we’ll first cover some considerations for choosing data shapes.
Then we’ll look at some common use cases: pivoting and unpivoting. We’ll see

## Page 76

examples of shaping data for specific analyses throughout the remaining
chapters. Chapter 8 will go into more detail on keeping complex SQL organized
when creating data sets for further analysis.
For Which Output: BI, Visualization, Statistics, ML
Deciding how to shape your data with SQL depends a lot on what you are
planning to do with the data afterward. It’s generally a good idea to output a data
set that has as few rows as possible while still meeting your need for granularity.
This will leverage the computing power of the database, reduce the time it takes
to move data from the database to somewhere else, and reduce the amount of
processing you or someone else needs to do in other tools. Some of the other
tools that your output might go to are a BI tool for reporting and dashboarding, a
spreadsheet for business users to examine, a statistics tool such as R, or a
machine learning model in Python—or you might output the data straight to a
visualization created with a range of tools.
When outputting data to a business intelligence tool for reports and dashboards,
it’s important to understand the use case. Data sets may need to be very detailed
to enable exploration and slicing by end users. They may need to be small and
aggregated and include specific calculations to enable fast loading and response
times in executive dashboards. Understanding how the tool works, and whether
it performs better with smaller data sets or is architected to perform its own
aggregations across larger data sets, is important. There is no “one size fits all”
answer. The more you know about how the data will be used, the better prepared
you will be to shape the data appropriately.
Smaller, aggregated, and highly specific data sets often work best for
visualizations, whether they are created in commercial software or using a
programming language like R, Python, or JavaScript. Think about the level of
aggregation and slices, or various elements, the end users will need to filter on.
Sometimes the data sets require a row for each slice, as well as an “everything”
slice. You may need to UNION together two queries—one at the detail level and
one at the “everything” level.
When creating output for statistics packages or machine learning models, it’s
important to understand the core entity being studied, the level of aggregation
desired, and the attributes or features needed. For example, a model might need

## Page 77

one record per customer with several attributes, or a record per transaction with
its associated attributes as well as customer attributes. Generally, the output for
modeling will follow the notion of “tidy data” proposed by Hadley Wickham.
Tidy data has these properties:
1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each value is a cell.
We will next look at how to use SQL to transform data from the structure in
which it exists in your database into any other pivoted or unpivoted structure that
is needed for analysis.
Pivoting with CASE Statements
A pivot table is a way to summarize data sets by arranging the data into rows,
according to the values of an attribute, and columns, according to the values of
another attribute. At the intersection of each row and column, a summary
statistic such as sum, count, or avg is calculated. Pivot tables are often a good
way to summarize data for business audiences, since they reshape the data into a
more compact and easily understandable form. Pivot tables are widely known
from their implementation in Microsoft Excel, which has a drag-and-drop
interface to create the summaries of data.
Pivot tables, or pivoted output, can be created in SQL using a CASE statement
along with one or more aggregation functions. We’ve seen CASE statements
several times so far, and reshaping data is another major use case for them. For
example, imagine we have an orders table with a row for each purchase made
by customers. To flatten the data, GROUP BY the customer_id and sum the
order_amount:
SELECT customer_id
,sum(order_amount) as total_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
; 
customer_id  total_amount

## Page 78

-----------  ------------
123          59.99
234          120.55
345          87.99
...          ...
To create a pivot, we will additionally create columns for each of the values of
an attribute. Imagine the orders table also has a product field that contains
the type of item purchased and the order_date. To create pivoted output,
GROUP BY the order_date, and sum the result of a CASE statement that
returns the order_amount whenever the row meets the product name criteria:
SELECT order_date
,sum(case when product = 'shirt' then order_amount 
          else 0 
          end) as shirts_amount
,sum(case when product = 'shoes' then order_amount 
          else 0 
          end) as shoes_amount
,sum(case when product = 'hat' then order_amount 
          else 0 
          end) hats_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
;
order_date  shirts_amount  shoes_amount  hats_amount
----------  -------------  ------------  -----------
2020-05-01  5268.56        1211.65       562.25
2020-05-02  5533.84        522.25        325.62
2020-05-03  5986.85        1088.62       858.35
...         ...            ...           ...
Note that with the sum aggregation, you can optionally use “else 0” to avoid
nulls in the result set. With count or count distinct, however, you
should not include an ELSE statement, as doing so would inflate the result set.
This is because the database won’t count a null, but it will count a substitute
value such as zero. 
Pivoting with CASE statements is quite handy, and having this ability opens up
data warehouse table designs that are long and narrow rather than wide, which
can be better for storing sparse data, because adding columns to a table can be an
expensive operation. For example, rather than storing various customer attributes

## Page 79

in many different columns, a table could contain multiple records per customer,
with each attribute in a separate row, and with attribute_name and
attribute_value fields specifying what the attribute is and its value. The
data can then be pivoted as needed to assemble a customer record with the
desired attributes. This design is efficient when there are many sparse attributes
(only a subset of customers have values for many of the attributes).
Pivoting data with a combination of aggregation and CASE statements works
well when there are a finite number of items to pivot. For people who have
worked with other programming languages, it’s essentially looping, but written
out explicitly line by line. This gives you a lot of control, such as if you want to
calculate different metrics in each column, but it can also be tedious. Pivoting
with case statements doesn’t work well when new values arrive constantly or are
rapidly changing, since the SQL code would need to be constantly updated. In
those cases, pushing the computing to another layer of your analysis stack, such
as a BI tool or statistical language, may be more appropriate.
Unpivoting with UNION Statements
Sometimes we have the opposite problem and need to move data stored in
columns into rows instead to create tidy data. This operation is called unpivoting.
Data sets that may need unpivoting are those that are in a pivot table format. As
an example, the populations of North American countries at 10-year intervals
starting in 1980 are shown in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4. Country population by year (in thousands)
To turn this into a result set with a row per country per year, we can use a
UNION operator. UNION is a way to combine data sets from multiple queries
into a single result set. There are two forms, UNION and UNION ALL. When
using UNION or UNION ALL, the numbers of columns in each component query
must match. The data types must match or be compatible (integers and floats can

## Page 80

be mixed, but integers and strings cannot). The column names in the result set
come from the first query. Aliasing the fields in the remaining queries is
therefore optional but can make a query easier to read:
SELECT country
,'1980' as year
,year_1980 as population
FROM country_populations
    UNION ALL
SELECT country
,'1990' as year
,year_1990 as population
FROM country_populations
    UNION ALL
SELECT country
,'2000' as year
,year_2000 as population
FROM country_populations
    UNION ALL
SELECT country
,'2010' as year
,year_2010 as population
FROM country_populations
;
country        year  population
-------------  ----  ----------
Canada         1980  24593
Mexico         1980  68347
United States  1980  227225
...            ...   ...
In this example, we use a constant to hardcode the year, in order to keep track of
the year that the population value corresponds to. The hardcoded values can be
of any type, depending on your use case. You may need to explicitly cast certain
hardcoded values, such as when entering a date:
'2020-01-01'::date as date_of_interest
What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL? Both can be used to
append or stack data together in this fashion, but they are slightly different.
UNION removes duplicates from the result set, whereas UNION ALL retains all
records, whether duplicates or not. UNION ALL is faster, since the database

## Page 81

doesn’t have to do a pass over the data to find duplicates. It also ensures that
every record ends up in the result set. I tend to use UNION ALL, using UNION
only when I have a reason to suspect duplicate data.
UNIONing data can also be useful for bringing together data from different
sources. For example, imagine we have a populations table with yearly data
per country, and another gdp table with yearly gross domestic product, or GDP.
One option is to JOIN the tables and obtain a result set with one column for
population and another for GDP:
SELECT a.country, a.population, b.gdp
FROM populations a
JOIN gdp b on a.country = b.country
;
Another option is to UNION ALL the data sets so that we end up with a stacked
data set:
SELECT country, 'population' as metric, population as metric_value
FROM populations
    UNION ALL
SELECT country, 'gdp' as metric, gdp as metric_value
FROM gdp
;
Which approach you use largely depends on the output that you need for your
analysis. The latter option can be useful when you have a number of different
metrics in different tables and no single table has a full set of entities (in this
case, countries). This is an alternative approach to a FULL OUTER JOIN.
pivot and unpivot Functions
Recognizing that the pivot and unpivot use cases are common, some database
vendors have implemented functions to do this with fewer lines of code.
Microsoft SQL Server and Snowflake have pivot functions that take the form
of extra expressions in the WHERE clause. Here, aggregation is any aggregation
function, such as sum or avg, the value_column is the field to be
aggregated, and a column will be created for each value of the label_column
listed as a label:

## Page 82

SELECT...
FROM... 
    pivot(aggregation(value_column) 
          for label_column in (label_1, label_2, ...)
;
We could rewrite the earlier pivoting example that used CASE statements as
follows:
SELECT *
FROM orders
  pivot(sum(order_amount) for product in ('shirt','shoes'))
GROUP BY order_date
;
Although this syntax is more compact than the CASE construction we saw
earlier, the desired columns still need to be specified. As a result, pivot doesn’t
solve the problem of newly arriving or rapidly changing sets of fields that need
to be turned into columns. Postgres has a similar crosstab function, available
in the tablefunc module.
Microsoft SQL Server and Snowflake also have unpivot functions that work
in a similar fashion to expressions in the WHERE clause and transform rows into
columns:
SELECT...
FROM... 
    unpivot( value_column for label_column in (label_1, label_2, ...))
;
For example, the country_populations data from the previous example
could be reshaped in the following manner:
SELECT *
FROM country_populations 
    unpivot(population for year in (year_1980, year_1990, year_2000, 
year_2010))
;
Here again the syntax is more compact than the UNION or UNION ALL
approach we looked at earlier, but the list of columns must be specified in the

## Page 83

query.
Postgres has an unnest array function that can be used to unpivot data, thanks
to its array data type. An array is a collection of elements, and in Postgres you
can list the elements of an array in square brackets. The function can be used in
the SELECT clause and takes this form:
unnest(array[element_1, element_2, ...])
Returning to our earlier example with countries and populations, this query
returns the same result as the query with the repeated UNION ALL clauses:
SELECT 
country
,unnest(array['1980', '1990', '2000', '2010']) as year
,unnest(array[year_1980, year_1990, year_2000, year_2010]) as pop
FROM country_populations
;
country  year  pop
-------  ----  -----
Canada   1980  24593
Canada   1990  27791
Canada   2000  31100
...      ...   ...
Data sets arrive in many different formats and shapes, and they aren’t always in
the format needed in our output. There are several options for reshaping data
through pivoting or unpivoting it, either with CASE statements or UNIONs, or
with database-specific functions. Understanding how to manipulate your data in
order to shape it in the way you want will give you greater flexibility in your
analysis and in the way you present your results.
Conclusion
Preparing data for analysis can feel like the work you do before you get to the
real work of analysis, but it is so fundamental to understanding the data that I
always find it is time well spent. Understanding the different types of data you’re
likely to encounter is critical, and you should take the time to understand the

## Page 84

data types in each table you work with. Profiling data helps us learn more about
what is in the data set and examine it for quality. I often return to profiling
throughout my analysis projects, as I learn more about the data and need to
check my query results along the way as I build in complexity. Data quality will
likely never stop being a problem, so we’ve looked at some ways to handle the
cleaning and enhancement of data sets. Finally, knowing how to shape the data
to create the right output format is essential. We’ll see these topics recur in the
context of various analyses throughout the book. The next chapter, on time series
analysis, starts our journey into specific analysis techniques.

Chapter 3. Time Series Analysis
Now that I’ve covered SQL and databases and the key steps in preparing data for
analysis, it’s time to turn to specific types of analysis that can be done with SQL.
There are a seemingly unending number of data sets in the world, and
correspondingly infinite ways in which they could be analyzed. In this and the
following chapters, I have organized types of analysis into themes that I hope
will be helpful as you build your analysis and SQL skills. Many of the
techniques to be discussed build on those shown in Chapter 2 and then on the
preceding chapters as the book progresses. Time series of data are so prevalent
and so important that I’ll start the series of analysis themes here.
Time series analysis is one of the most common types of analysis done with
SQL. A time series is a sequence of measurements or data points recorded in
time order, often at regularly spaced intervals. There are many examples of time
series data in daily life, such as the daily high temperature, the closing value of
the S&P 500 stock index, or the number of daily steps recorded by your fitness
tracker. Time series analysis is used in a wide variety of industries and
disciplines, from statistics and engineering to weather forecasting and business
planning. Time series analysis is a way to understand and quantify how things
change over time.
Forecasting is a common goal of time series analysis. Since time only marches
forward, future values can be expressed as a function of past values, while the
reverse is not true. However, it’s important to note that the past doesn’t perfectly
predict the future. Any number of changes to wider market conditions, popular
trends, product introductions, or other large changes make forecasting difficult.
Still, looking at historical data can lead to insights, and developing a range of
plausible outcomes is useful for planning. As I’m writing this, the world is in the
midst of a global COVID-19 pandemic, the likes of which haven’t been seen in
100 years—predating all but the most long-lived organizations’ histories. Thus
many current organizations haven’t seen this specific event before, but they have
existed through other economic crises, such as those following the dot-com burst
and the 9/11 attacks in 2001, as well as the global financial crisis of 2007–2008.

## Page 86

With careful analysis and understanding of context, we can often extract useful
insights.
In this chapter, we’ll first cover the SQL building blocks of time series analysis:
syntax and functions for working with dates, timestamps, and time. Next, I’ll
introduce the retail sales data set used for examples throughout the rest of the
chapter. A discussion of methods for trending analysis follows, and then I’ll
cover calculating rolling time windows. Next are period-over-period calculations
to analyze data with seasonality components. Finally, we’ll wrap up with some
additional techniques that are useful for time series analysis.
Date, Datetime, and Time Manipulations
Dates and times come in a wide variety of formats, depending on the data
source. We often need or want to transform the raw data format for our output, or
to perform calculations to arrive at new dates or parts of dates. For example, the
data set might contain transaction timestamps, but the goal of the analysis is to
trend monthly sales. At other times, we might want to know how many days or
months have elapsed since a particular event. Fortunately, SQL has powerful
functions and formatting capabilities that can transform just about any raw input
to almost any output we might need for analysis.
In this section, I’ll show you how to convert between time zones, and then I’ll go
into depth on formatting dates and datetimes. Next, I’ll explore date math and
time manipulations, including those that make use of intervals. An interval is a
data type that holds a span of time, such as a number of months, days, or hours.
Although data can be stored in a database table as an interval type, in practice I
rarely see this done, so I will talk about intervals alongside the date and time
functions that you can use them with. Last, I’ll discuss some special
considerations when joining or otherwise combining data from different sources.
Time Zone Conversions
Understanding the standard time zone used in a data set can prevent
misunderstandings and mistakes further into the analysis process. Time zones
split the world into north-south regions that observe the same time. Time zones
allow different parts of the world to have similar clock times for daytime and

## Page 87

nighttime—so, for example, the sun is overhead at 12 p.m. wherever you are in
the world. The zones follow irregular boundaries that are as much political as
geographic ones. Most are one hour apart, but some are offset only 30 or 45
minutes, and so there are more than 30 time zones spanning the globe. Many
countries that are distant from the equator observe daylight savings time for parts
of the year as well, but there are exceptions, such as in the United States and
Australia, where some states observe daylight savings time and others do not.
Each time zone has a standard abbreviation, such as PST for Pacific Standard
Time and PDT for Pacific Daylight Time.
Many databases are set to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the global
standard used to regulate clocks, and record events in this time zone. It replaced
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which you might still see if your data comes
from an older database. UTC does not have daylight savings time, so it stays
consistent all year long. This turns out to be quite useful for analysis. I remember
one time a panicked product manager asked me to figure out why sales on a
particular Sunday dropped so much compared to the prior Sunday. I spent hours
writing queries and investigating possible causes before eventually figuring out
that our data was recorded in Pacific Time (PT). Daylight savings started early
Sunday morning, the database clock moved ahead 1 hour, and the day had only
23 hours instead of 24, and thus sales appeared to drop. Half a year later we had
a corresponding 25-hour day, when sales appeared unusually high.
NOTE
Often timestamps in the database are not encoded with the time zone, and you will need to
consult with the source or developer to figure out how your data was stored. UTC has become
most common in the data sets I see, but that is certainly not universal.
One drawback to UTC, or really to any logging of machine time, is that we lose
information about the local time for the human doing the actions that generated
the event recorded in the database. I might want to know whether people tend to
use my mobile app more during the workday or during nights and weekends. If
my audience is clustered in one time zone, it’s not hard to figure this out. But if
the audience spans multiple time zones or is international, then it becomes a
calculation task of converting each recorded time to its local time zone.

## Page 88

All local time zones have a UTC offset. For example, the offset for PDT is UTC
– 7 hours, while the offset for PST is UTC – 8 hours. Timestamps in databases
are stored in the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mi:ss (for years-months-days
hours:minutes:seconds). Timestamps with the time zone have an additional piece
of information for the UTC offset, expressed as a positive or negative number.
Converting from one time zone to another can be accomplished with at time
zone followed by the destination time zone’s abbreviation. For example, we can
convert a timestamp in UTC (offset – 0) to PST:
SELECT '2020-09-01 00:00:00 -0' at time zone 'pst';
timezone
-------------------
2020-08-31 16:00:00
The destination time zone name can be a constant, or a database field, allowing
this conversion to be dynamic to the data set. Some databases have a
convert_timezone or convert_tz function that works similarly. One
argument is the time zone of the result, and the other argument is the time zone
from which to convert:
SELECT convert_timezone('pst','2020-09-01 00:00:00 -0');
timezone
-------------------
2020-08-31 16:00:00
Check your database’s documentation for the exact name and ordering of the
target time zone and the source timestamp arguments. Many databases contain a
list of time zones and their abbreviations in a system table. Some common ones
are seen in Table 3-1. These can be queried with SELECT * FROM the table
name. Wikipedia also has a useful list of standard time zone abbreviations and
their UTC offsets.

Time zones are an innate part of working with timestamps. With time zone
conversion functions, moving between the time zone in which the data was
recorded and any other world time zone is possible. Next, I’ll show you a variety
of techniques for manipulating dates and timestamps with SQL.
Date and Timestamp Format Conversions
Dates and timestamps are key to time series analysis. Due to the wide variety of
ways in which dates and times can be represented in source data, it is almost
inevitable that you will need to convert date formats at some point. In this
section, I’ll cover several of the most common conversions and how to
accomplish them with SQL: changing the data type, extracting parts of a date or
timestamp, and creating a date or timestamp from parts. I’ll begin by introducing
some handy functions that return the current date and/or time.
Returning the current date or time is a common analysis task—for example, to
include a timestamp for the result set or to use in date math, covered in the next
section. The current date and time are referred to as system time, and while
returning them is easy to do with SQL, there are some syntax differences
between databases.
To return the current date, some databases have a current_date function,
with no parentheses:
SELECT current_date;
There is a wider variety of functions to return the current date and time. Check
your database’s documentation or just experiment by typing into a SQL window
to see whether a function returns a value or an error. The functions with
parentheses do not take arguments, but it is important to include the parentheses:
current_timestamp
localtimestamp
get_date()
now()

## Page 90

Finally, there are functions to return only the timestamp portion of the current
system time. Again, consult documentation or experiment to figure out which
function(s) to use with your database:
current_time
localtime
timeofday()
SQL has a number of functions for changing the format of dates and times. To
reduce the granularity of a timestamp, use the date_trunc function. The first
argument is a text value indicating the time period level to which to truncate the
timestamp in the second argument. The result is a timestamp value:
date_trunc (text, timestamp)
SELECT date_trunc('month','2020-10-04 12:33:35'::timestamp);
date_trunc
-------------------
2020-10-01 00:00:00
Standard arguments that can be used are listed in Table 3-2. They range all the
way from microseconds to millennia, providing plenty of flexibility. Databases
that don’t support date_trunc, such as MySQL, have an alternate function
called date_format that can be used in a similar way:
SELECT date_format('2020-10-04 12:33:35','%Y-%m-01') as date_trunc;
date_trunc
-------------------
2020-10-01 00:00:00

Rather than returning dates or timestamps, sometimes our analysis calls for parts
of dates or times. For example, we might want to group sales by month, day of
the week, or hour of the day.
SQL provides a few functions for returning just the part of the date or timestamp
required. Dates and timestamps are usually interchangeable, except when the
request is to return a time part. In those cases, time is of course required.
The date_part function takes a text value for the part to be returned and a
date or timestamp value. The returned value is a FLOAT, which is a numeric
value with a decimal part; depending on your needs, you may want to cast the
value to an integer data type:
SELECT date_part('day',current_timestamp);
SELECT date_part('month',current_timestamp);
SELECT date_part('hour',current_timestamp);
Another function that works similarly is extract, which takes a part name and
a date or timestamp value and returns a FLOAT value:
SELECT extract('day' from current_timestamp);
date_part
---------
27.0
SELECT extract('month' from current_timestamp);

## Page 92

date_part
---------
5.0
SELECT extract('hour' from current_timestamp);
date_part
---------
14.0
The functions date_part and extract can be used with intervals, but note
that the requested part must match the units of the interval. So, for example,
requesting days from an interval stated in days returns the expected value of 30:
SELECT date_part('day',interval '30 days');
SELECT extract('day' from interval '30 days');
date_part
---------
30.0
However, requesting days from an interval stated in months returns a value of
0.0:
SELECT extract('day' from interval '3 months');
date_part
---------
0.0
NOTE
A full list of date parts can be found in your database’s documentation or by searching online,
but some of the most common are “day,” “month,” and “year” for dates, and “second,”
“minute,” and “hour” for timestamps.
To return text values of the date parts, use the to_char function, which takes
the input value and the output format as arguments:
SELECT to_char(current_timestamp,'Day');

## Page 93

SELECT to_char(current_timestamp,'Month');
TIP
If you ever encounter timestamps stored as Unix epochs (the number of seconds that have
elapsed since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC), you can convert them to timestamps using
the to_timestamp function.
Sometimes analysis calls for creating a date from parts from different sources.
This can occur when the year, month, and day values are stored in different
columns in the database. It can also be necessary when the parts have been
parsed out of text, a topic I’ll cover in more depth in Chapter 5.
A simple way to create a timestamp from separate date and time components is
to concatenate them together with a plus sign (+):
SELECT date '2020-09-01' + time '03:00:00' as timestamp;
timestamp 
-------------------
2020-09-01 03:00:00
A date can be assembled using the make_date, makedate,
date_from_parts, or datefromparts function. These are equivalent,
but different databases name the functions differently. The function takes
arguments for the year, month, and day parts and returns a value with a date
format:
SELECT make_date(2020,09,01);
make_date
----------
2020-09-01
The arguments can be constants or reference field names and must be integers.
Yet another way to assemble a date or timestamp is to concatenate the values
together and then cast the result to a date format using one of the casting
syntaxes or the to_date function:

## Page 94

SELECT to_date(concat(2020,'-',09,'-',01), 'yyyy-mm-dd');
to_date
----------
2020-09-01
SELECT cast(concat(2020,'-',09,'-',01) as date);
to_date
----------
2020-09-01
SQL has a number of ways to format and convert dates and timestamps and
retrieve system dates and times. In the next section, I will start putting them to
use in date math.
Date Math
SQL allows us to do various mathematical operations on dates. This might be
surprising since, strictly speaking, dates are not numeric data types, but the
concept should be familiar if you’ve ever tried to figure out what day it will be
four weeks from now. Date math is useful for a variety of analytics tasks. For
example, we can use it to find the age or tenure of a customer, how much time
elapsed between two events, and how many things occurred within a window of
time.
Date math involves two types of data: the dates themselves and intervals. We
need the concept of intervals because date and time components don’t behave
like integers. One-tenth of 100 is 10; one-tenth of a year is 36.5 days. Half of
100 is 50; half of a day is 12 hours. Intervals allow us to move smoothly
between units of time. Intervals come in two types: year-month intervals and
day-time ones. We’ll start with a few operations that return integer values and
then move on to functions that work with or return intervals.
First, let’s find the days elapsed between two dates. There are several ways to do
this in SQL. The first way is by using a mathematical operator, the minus sign
(–):
SELECT date('2020-06-30') - date('2020-05-31') as days;
days

## Page 95

----

This returns the number of days between these two dates. Note that the answer is
30 days and not 31. The number of days is inclusive of only one of the
endpoints. Subtracting the dates in the reverse also works and returns an interval
of –30 days:
SELECT date('2020-05-31') - date('2020-06-30') as days;
days
----
-30
Finding the difference between two dates can also be accomplished with the
datediff function. Postgres does not support it, but many other popular
databases do, including SQL Server, Redshift, and Snowflake, and it’s quite
handy, particularly when the goal is to return an interval other than the number
of days. The function takes three arguments—the time period units you want to
return, a starting timestamp or date, and an ending timestamp or date:
datediff(interval_name, start_timestamp, end_timestamp)
So our previous example would look like this:
SELECT datediff('day',date('2020-05-31'), date('2020-06-30')) as days;
days
----

We can also find the number of months between two dates, and the database will
do the correct math even though month lengths differ throughout the year:
SELECT datediff('month'
                ,date('2020-01-01')
                ,date('2020-06-30')
                ) as months;
months
------

## Page 96

In Postgres, this can be accomplished using the age function, which calculates
the interval between two dates:
SELECT age(date('2020-06-30'),date('2020-01-01'));
age
--------------
5 mons 29 days
We can then find the number of months component of the interval with the
date_part() function:
SELECT date_part('month',age('2020-06-30','2020-01-01')) as months;
months
------
5.0
Subtracting dates to find the time elapsed between them is quite powerful.
Adding dates does not work in the same way. To do addition with dates, we need
to leverage intervals or special functions.
For example, we can add seven days to a date by adding the interval '7
days':
SELECT date('2020-06-01') + interval '7 days' as new_date;
new_date
-------------------
2020-06-08 00:00:00
Some databases don’t require the interval syntax and instead automatically
convert the provided number to days, although it’s generally good practice to use
the interval notation, both for cross-database compatibility and to make your
code easier to read:
SELECT date('2020-06-01') + 7 as new_date;
new_date
-------------------

## Page 97

2020-06-08 00:00:00
If you want to add a different unit of time, use the interval notation with months,
years, hours, or another date or time period. Note that this can also be used to
subtract intervals from dates by using a “-” instead of a “+.” Many but not all
databases have a date_add or dateadd function that takes the desired
interval, a value, and the starting date and does the math:
SELECT date_add('month',1,'2020-06-01') as new_date;
new_date
----------
2020-07-01
TIP
Consult your database’s documentation, or just experiment with queries, to figure out the
syntax and functions that are available and appropriate for your project.
Any of these formulations can be used in the WHERE clause in addition to the
SELECT clause. For example, we can filter to records that occurred at least three
months ago:
WHERE event_date < current_date - interval '3 months'
They can also be used in JOIN conditions, but note that database performance
will usually be slower when the JOIN condition contains a calculation rather
than an equality or inequality between dates.
Using date math is common in analysis with SQL, both to find the time elapsed
between dates or timestamps and to calculate new dates based on an interval
from a known date. There are several ways to find the elapsed time between two
dates, add intervals to dates, and subtract intervals from dates. Next, we’ll turn to
time manipulations, which are similar.
Time Math
Time math is less common in many areas of analysis, but it can be useful in

## Page 98

some situations. For example, we might want to know how long it takes for a
support representative to answer a phone call in a call center or respond to an
email requesting assistance. Whenever the elapsed time between two events is
less than a day, or when rounding the result to a number of days doesn’t provide
enough information, time manipulation comes into play. Time math works
similarly to date math, by leveraging intervals. We can add time intervals to
times:
SELECT time '05:00' + interval '3 hours' as new_time;
new_time
--------
08:00:00
We can subtract intervals from times:
SELECT time '05:00' - interval '3 hours' as new_time;
new_time
--------
02:00:00
We can also subtract times, resulting in an interval:
SELECT time '05:00' - time '03:00' as time_diff;
time_diff
---------
02:00:00
Times, unlike dates, can be multiplied:
SELECT time '05:00' * 2 as time_multiplied;
time_multiplied
---------------
10:00:00
Intervals can also be multiplied, resulting in a time value:
SELECT interval '1 second' * 2000 as interval_multiplied;

## Page 99

interval_multiplied
-------------------
00:33:20
SELECT interval '1 day' * 45 as interval_multiplied;
interval_multiplied
-------------------
45 days
These examples use constant values, but you can include database field names or
calculations in the SQL query as well to make the calculations dynamic. Next,
I’ll discuss special date considerations to keep in mind when combining data sets
from different source systems.
Joining Data from Different Sources
Combining data from different sources is one of the most compelling use cases
for a data warehouse. However, different source systems can record dates and
times in different formats or different time zones or even just be off slightly due
to issues with the internal clock time of the server. Even tables from the same
data source can have differences, though this is less common. Reconciling and
standardizing dates and timestamps is an important step before moving further in
the analysis.
Dates and timestamps that are in different formats can be standardized with
SQL. JOINing on dates or including date fields in UNIONs generally requires
that the dates or timestamps be in the same format. Earlier in the chapter, I
showed techniques for formatting dates and timestamps that will serve well with
these problems. Take care with time zones when combining data from different
sources. For example, an internal database may use UTC time, but data from a
third party could be in a local time zone. I have seen data sourced from software
as a service (SaaS) that was recorded in a variety of local times. Note that the
timestamp values themselves won’t necessarily have the time zone embedded.
You may need to consult the vendor’s documentation and convert the data to
UTC if the rest of your data is stored that way. Another option is to store the
time zone in a field so that the timestamp value can be converted as needed.
Another thing to look out for when working with data from different sources is

## Page 100

timestamps that are slightly out of sync. This can happen when timestamps are
recorded from client devices—for example, from a laptop or mobile phone in
one data source and a server in the other data source. I once saw a series of
experiment results be miscalculated because the client mobile device that
recorded a user’s action was offset by a few minutes from the server that
recorded the treatment group to which the user was assigned. Data from the
mobile clients appeared to arrive before the treatment group timestamp, so some
events were inadvertently excluded. A fix for something like this is relatively
straightforward: rather than filter for action timestamps greater than the
treatment group timestamp, allow events within a short interval or window of
time prior to the treatment timestamp to be included in the results. This can be
accomplished with a BETWEEN clause and date math, as seen in the last section.
When working with data from mobile apps, pay particular attention to whether
the timestamps represent when the action happened on the device or when the
event arrived in the database. The difference can range from negligible all the
way up to days, depending on whether the mobile app allows offline usage and
on how it handles sending data during periods of low signal strength. Data from
mobile apps can be late-arriving or may make its way into the database days
after it occurred on the device. Dates and timestamps can also become corrupted
en route, and you may see ones that are impossibly distant in the past or future as
a result.
Now that I’ve shown how to manipulate dates, datetimes, and time by changing
the formats, converting time zones, performing date math, and working across
data sets from different sources, we’re ready to get into some time series
examples. First, I’ll introduce the data set for examples in the rest of the chapter.
The Retail Sales Data Set
The examples in the rest of this chapter use a data set of monthly US retail sales
from the Monthly Retail Trade Report: Retail and Food Services Sales: Excel
(1992–present), available on the Census.gov website. The data in this report is
used as an economic indicator to understand trends in US consumer spending
patterns. While gross domestic product (GDP) figures are published quarterly,
this retail sales data is published monthly, so it is also used to help predict GDP.

## Page 101

For both of these reasons, the latest figures are usually covered in the business
press when they are released.
The data spans from 1992 to 2020 and includes both total sales as well as details
for subcategories of retail sales. It contains both unadjusted and seasonally
adjusted numbers. This chapter will use the unadjusted numbers, since one of the
goals is analyzing seasonality. Sales figures are in millions of US dollars. The
original file format is an Excel file, with a tab for each year and with months as
columns. The GitHub site for this book has the data in a format that’s easier to
import into a database, along with code specifically for importing into Postgres.
Figure 3-1 shows a sample of the retail_sales table.

## Page 102

Trending the Data
With time series data, we often want to look for trends in the data. A trend is
simply the direction in which the data is moving. It may be moving up or
increasing over time, or it may be moving down or decreasing over time. It can
remain more or less flat, or there could be so much noise, or movement up and
down, that it’s hard to determine a trend at all. This section will cover several
techniques for trending time series data, from simple trends for graphing to
comparing components of a trend, using percent of total calculations to compare
parts to the whole, and finally indexing to see the percent change from a
reference time period.
Simple Trends
Creating a trend may be a step in profiling and understanding data, or it may be
the final output. The result set is a series of dates or timestamps and a numerical
value. When graphing a time series, the dates or timestamps will become the x-
axis, and the numerical value will be the y-axis. For example, we can check the
trend of total retail and food services sales in the US:
SELECT sales_month
,sales
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Retail and food services sales, total'
;
sales_month  sales
-----------  ------
1992-01-01   146376
1992-02-01   147079
1992-03-01   159336
...          ...
The results are graphed in Figure 3-2.

## Page 104

Figure 3-2. Trend of monthly retail and food services sales
This data clearly has some patterns, but it also has some noise. Transforming the
data and aggregating at the yearly level can help us gain a better understanding.
First, we’ll use the date_part function to return just the year from the
sales_month field and then sum the sales. The results are filtered to the
“Retail and food services sales, total” kind_of_business in the WHERE
clause:
SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year   
,sum(sales) as sales
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Retail and food services sales, total'
GROUP BY 1
;
sales_year  sales
----------  -------
1992.0      2014102
1993.0      2153095
1994.0      2330235
...         ...
After graphing this data, as in Figure 3-3, we now have a smoother time series
that is generally increasing over time, as might be expected, since the sales
values are not adjusted for inflation. Sales for all retail and food services fell in
2009, during the global financial crisis. After growing every year throughout the
2010s, sales were flat in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

## Page 106

Figure 3-3. Trend of yearly total retail and food services sales
Graphing time series data at different levels of aggregation, such as weekly,
monthly, or yearly, is a good way to understand trends. This step can be used to
simply profile the data, but it can also be the final output, depending on the goals
of the analysis. Next, we’ll turn to using SQL to compare components of a time
series.
Comparing Components
Often data sets contain not just a single time series but multiple slices or
components of a total across the same time range. Comparing these slices often
reveals interesting patterns. In the retail sales data set, there are values for total
sales but also a number of subcategories. Let’s compare the yearly sales trend for
a few categories that are associated with leisure activities: book stores, sporting
goods stores, and hobby stores. This query adds kind_of_business in the
SELECT clause and, since it is another attribute rather than an aggregation, adds
it to the GROUP BY clause  as well:
SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
,kind_of_business
,sum(sales) as sales
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business in ('Book stores'
 ,'Sporting goods stores','Hobby, toy, and game stores')
GROUP BY 1,2
;
sales_year  kind_of_business             sales
----------  ---------------------------  -----
1992.0      Book stores                  8327
1992.0      Hobby, toy, and game stores  11251
1992.0      Sporting goods stores        15583
...         ...                          ...
The results are graphed in Figure 3-4. Sales at sporting goods retailers started the
highest among the three categories and grew much faster during the time period,
and by the end of the time series, those sales were substantially higher. Sales at
sporting goods stores started declining in 2017 but had a big rebound in 2020.
Sales at hobby, toy, and game stores were relatively flat over this time span, with
a slight dip in the mid-2000s and another slight decline prior to a rebound in

## Page 107

2020. Sales at book stores grew until the mid-2000s and have been on the
decline since then. All of these categories have been impacted by the growth of
online retailers, but the timing and magnitude seem to differ.

## Page 109

Figure 3-4. Trend of yearly retail sales for sporting goods stores; hobby, toy, and game stores; and book
stores
In addition to looking at simple trends, we might want to perform more complex
comparisons between parts of the time series. For the next few examples, we’ll
look at sales at women’s clothing stores and at men’s clothing stores. Note that
since the names contain apostrophes, the character otherwise used to indicate the
beginning and end of strings, we need to escape them with an extra apostrophe.
This lets the database know that the apostrophe is part of the string rather than
the end. Although we might consider adding a step in a data-loading pipeline
that removes extra apostrophes in names, I’ve left them in here as a
demonstration of the types of code adjustments that are often needed in the real
world. First, we’ll trend the data for each type of store by month:
SELECT sales_month
,kind_of_business
,sales
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
 ,'Women''s clothing stores')
;
sales_month  kind_of_business         sales
-----------  -----------------------  -----
1992-01-01   Men's clothing stores    701
1992-01-01   Women's clothing stores  1873
1992-02-01   Women's clothing stores  1991
...          ...                      ...
The results are graphed in Figure 3-5. Sales at women’s clothing retailers are
much higher than those at men’s clothing retailers. Both types of stores exhibit
seasonality, a topic I’ll cover in depth in “Analyzing with Seasonality”. Both
experienced significant drops in 2020 due to store closures and a reduction in
shopping because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Page 111

Figure 3-5. Monthly trend of sales at women’s and men’s clothing stores
The monthly data has intriguing patterns but is noisy, so we’ll use yearly
aggregates for the next few examples. We’ve seen this query format previously
when rolling up total sales and sales for leisure categories:
SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
,kind_of_business
,sum(sales) as sales
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
 ,'Women''s clothing stores')
GROUP BY 1,2
;
Are sales at women’s clothing stores uniformly higher than those at men’s
clothing stores? In the yearly trend shown in Figure 3-6, the gap between men’s
and women’s sales does not appear constant but rather was increasing during the
early to mid-2000s. Women’s clothing sales in particular dipped during the
global financial crisis of 2008–2009, and sales in both categories dropped a lot
during the pandemic in 2020.

## Page 113

Figure 3-6. Yearly trend of sales at women’s and men’s clothing stores
We don’t need to rely on visual estimation, however. For more precision on this
gap, we can calculate the gap between the two categories, the ratio, and the
percent difference between them. To do this, the first step is to arrange the data
so that there is a single row for each month, with a column for each category.
Pivoting the data with aggregate functions combined with CASE statements
accomplishes this:
SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores' 
          then sales 
          end) as womens_sales
,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Men''s clothing stores' 
          then sales 
          end) as mens_sales
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
 ,'Women''s clothing stores')
GROUP BY 1
;
sales_year  womens_sales  mens_sales
----------  ------------  ----------
1992.0      31815         10179
1993.0      32350         9962
1994.0      30585         10032
...         ...           ...
With this building block calculation, we can find the difference, ratio, and
percent difference between time series in the data set. The difference can be
calculated by subtracting one value from the other using the mathematical “–”
operator. Depending on the goals of the analysis, either finding the difference
from men’s sales or finding the difference from women’s sales might be
appropriate. Both are shown here and are equivalent except for the sign:
SELECT sales_year
,womens_sales - mens_sales as womens_minus_mens
,mens_sales - womens_sales as mens_minus_womens
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
    ,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores' 
              then sales

## Page 114

end) as womens_sales
    ,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Men''s clothing stores' 
              then sales 
              end) as mens_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
     ,'Women''s clothing stores')
    and sales_month <= '2019-12-01'
    GROUP BY 1
) a
;
sales_year  womens_minus_mens  mens_minus_womens
----------  -----------------  -----------------
1992.0      21636              -21636
1993.0      22388              -22388
1994.0      20553              -20553
...         ...                ...
The subquery is not required from a query execution standpoint, since
aggregations can be added to or subtracted from each other. A subquery is often
more legible but does add more lines to the code. Depending on how long or
complex the rest of your SQL query is, you might prefer to place the
intermediate calculation in a subquery, or just calculate it in the main query. Here
is an example without the subquery, subtracting men’s sales from women’s sales,
with an added WHERE clause filter to remove 2020, since a few months have
null values:
SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores' 
          then sales end) 
 - 
 sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Men''s clothing stores' 
          then sales end)
 as womens_minus_mens
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
 ,'Women''s clothing stores')
and sales_month <= '2019-12-01'
GROUP BY 1
;
sales_year  womens_minus_mens
----------  -----------------
1992.0      21636
1993.0      22388

## Page 115

1994.0      20553
...         ...
Figure 3-7 shows that the gap decreased between 1992 and about 1997, began a
long increase through about 2011 (with a brief dip in 2007), and then was more
or less flat through 2019.

## Page 117

Figure 3-7. Yearly difference between sales at women’s and men’s clothing stores
Let’s continue our investigation and look at the ratio of these categories. We’ll
use men’s sales as the baseline or denominator, but note that we could just as
easily use women’s store sales instead:
SELECT sales_year
,womens_sales / mens_sales as womens_times_of_mens
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
    ,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores' 
              then sales 
              end) as womens_sales
    ,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Men''s clothing stores' 
              then sales 
              end) as mens_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
     ,'Women''s clothing stores')
    and sales_month <= '2019-12-01'
    GROUP BY 1
) a
;
sales_year  womens_times_of_mens
----------  --------------------
1992.0      3.1255526083112290
1993.0      3.2473398915880345
1994.0      3.0487440191387560
...         ...
TIP
SQL returns a lot of decimal digits when performing division. You should generally consider
rounding the result before presenting the analysis. Use the level of precision (number of
decimal places) that tells the story.
Plotting the result, shown in Figure 3-8, reveals that the trend is similar to the
difference trend, but while there was a drop in the difference in 2009, the ratio
actually increased.

## Page 119

Figure 3-8. Yearly ratio of women’s to men’s clothing sales
Next, we can calculate the percent difference between sales at women’s and
men’s clothing stores:
SELECT sales_year
,(womens_sales / mens_sales - 1) * 100 as womens_pct_of_mens
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
    ,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores' 
              then sales 
              end) as womens_sales
    ,sum(case when kind_of_business = 'Men''s clothing stores' 
              then sales 
              end) as mens_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
     ,'Women''s clothing stores')
    and sales_month <= '2019-12-01'
    GROUP BY 1
) a
;
sales_year  womens_pct_of_mens
----------  --------------------
1992.0      212.5552608311229000
1993.0      224.7339891588034500
1994.0      204.8744019138756000
...         ...
Although the units for this output are different from those in the previous
example, the shape of this graph is the same as that of the ratio graph. The
choice of which to use depends on your audience and the norms in your domain.
All of these statements are accurate: in 2009, sales at women’s clothing stores
were $28.7 billion higher than sales at men’s stores; in 2009, sales at women’s
clothing stores were 4.9 times the sales at men’s stores; in 2009, sales at
women’s stores were 390% higher than sales at men’s stores. Which version to
select depends on the story you want to tell with the analysis.
The transformations we’ve seen in this section allow us to analyze time series by
comparing related parts. The next section will continue the theme of comparing
time series by showing ways to analyze series that represent parts of a whole.

## Page 120

Percent of Total Calculations
When working with time series data that has multiple parts or attributes that
constitute a whole, it’s often useful to analyze each part’s contribution to the
whole and whether that has changed over time. Unless the data already contains
a time series of the total values, we’ll need to calculate the overall total in order
to calculate the percent of total for each row. This can be accomplished with a
self-JOIN, or a window function, which as we saw in Chapter 2 is a special kind
of SQL function that can reference any row within a specified partition of the
table.
First I’ll show the self-JOIN method. A self-JOIN is any time a table is joined to
itself. As long as each instance of the table in the query is given a different alias,
the database will treat them all as distinct tables. For example, to find the percent
of combined men’s and women’s clothing sales that each series represents, we
can JOIN retail_sales, aliased as a, to retail_sales, aliased as b, on
the sales_month field. We then SELECT the individual series name
(kind_of_business) and sales values from alias a. Then, from alias b we
sum the sales for both categories and call the result total_sales. Note
that the JOIN between the tables on the sales_month field creates a partial
Cartesian JOIN, which results in two rows from alias b for each row in alias a.
Grouping by a.sales_month, a.kind_of_business, and a.sales
and aggregating b.sales returns exactly the results needed, however. In the
outer query, the percent of total for each row is calculated by dividing sales by
total_sales:
SELECT sales_month
,kind_of_business
,sales * 100 / total_sales as pct_total_sales
FROM
(
    SELECT a.sales_month, a.kind_of_business, a.sales
    ,sum(b.sales) as total_sales
    FROM retail_sales a
    JOIN retail_sales b on a.sales_month = b.sales_month
    and b.kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
     ,'Women''s clothing stores')
    WHERE a.kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
     ,'Women''s clothing stores')
    GROUP BY 1,2,3

## Page 121

) aa
;
sales_month  kind_of_business         pct_total_sales
-----------  -----------------------  -------------------
1992-01-01   Men's clothing stores    27.2338772338772339
1992-01-01   Women's clothing stores  72.7661227661227661

...          ...                      ...
The subquery isn’t required here, as the same result could be obtained without it,
but it makes the code a little easier to follow. A second way to calculate the
percent of total sales for each category is to use the sum window function and
PARTITION BY the sales_month. Recall that the PARTITION BY clause
indicates the section of the table within which the function should calculate. The
ORDER BY clause is not required in this sum window function, because the
order of calculation doesn’t matter. Additionally, the query does not need a
GROUP BY clause, because window functions look across multiple rows, but
they do not reduce the number of rows in the result set:
SELECT sales_month, kind_of_business, sales
,sum(sales) over (partition by sales_month) as total_sales
,sales * 100 / sum(sales) over (partition by sales_month) as pct_total
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
 ,'Women''s clothing stores')
;
sales_month  kind_of_business         sales  total_sales  pct_total
-----------  -----------------------  -----  -----------  ---------
1992-01-01   Men's clothing stores    701    2574         27.233877
1992-01-01   Women's clothing stores  1873   2574         72.766122
1992-02-01   Women's clothing stores  1991   2649         75.160437
...          ...                      ...    ...          ...
Graphing this data, as in Figure 3-9, reveals some interesting trends. First,
starting in the late 1990s, women’s clothing store sales became an increasing
percentage of the total.  Second, early in the series a seasonal pattern is evident,
where men’s sales spike as a percent of total sales in December and January. In
the first decade of the 21st century, two seasonal peaks appear, in the summer
and the winter, but by the late 2010s, the seasonal patterns are dampened almost
to the point of randomness. We’ll take a look at analyzing seasonality in greater

## Page 122

depth later in this chapter.
Figure 3-9. Men’s and women’s clothing store sales as percent of monthly total
Another percent of total we might want to find is the percent of sales within a
longer time period, such as the percent of yearly sales each month represents.

## Page 123

Again, either a self-JOIN or a window function will do the job. In this example,
we’ll use a self-JOIN in the subquery:
SELECT sales_month
,kind_of_business
,sales * 100 / yearly_sales as pct_yearly
FROM
(
    SELECT a.sales_month, a.kind_of_business, a.sales
    ,sum(b.sales) as yearly_sales
    FROM retail_sales a
    JOIN retail_sales b on 
     date_part('year',a.sales_month) = date_part('year',b.sales_month)
     and a.kind_of_business = b.kind_of_business
     and b.kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
      ,'Women''s clothing stores')
    WHERE a.kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
     ,'Women''s clothing stores')
    GROUP BY 1,2,3
) aa
;
sales_month  kind_of_business       pct_yearly
-----------  ---------------------  ------------------
1992-01-01   Men's clothing stores  6.8867275763827488
1992-02-01   Men's clothing stores  6.4642892229099126
1992-03-01   Men's clothing stores  7.1814520090382159
...          ...                    ...
Alternatively, the window function method can be used:
SELECT sales_month, kind_of_business, sales
,sum(sales) over (partition by date_part('year',sales_month)
                               ,kind_of_business
                               ) as yearly_sales
,sales * 100 / 
 sum(sales) over (partition by date_part('year',sales_month)
                               ,kind_of_business
                               ) as pct_yearly
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
 ,'Women''s clothing stores')
;
sales_month  kind_of_business       pct_yearly
-----------  ---------------------  ------------------
1992-01-01   Men's clothing stores  6.8867275763827488

## Page 124

...          ...                    ...
The results, zoomed in to 2019, are shown in Figure 3-10. The two time series
track fairly closely, but men’s stores had a greater percentage of their sales in
January than did women’s stores. Men’s stores had a summer dip in July, while
the corresponding dip in women’s store sales wasn’t until September.

Now that I’ve shown how to use SQL for percent of total calculations and the
types of analysis that can be accomplished, I’ll turn to indexing and calculating
percent change over time.
Indexing to See Percent Change over Time
The values in time series usually fluctuate over time. Sales increase with
growing popularity and availability of a product, while web page response time
decreases with engineers’ efforts to optimize code. Indexing data is a way to
understand the changes in a time series relative to a base period (starting point).
Indices are widely used in economics as well as business settings. One of the
most famous indices is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the change
in the prices of items that a typical consumer purchases and is used to track
inflation, to decide salary increases, and for many other applications. The CPI is
a complex statistical measure using various weights and data inputs, but the
basic premise is straightforward. Pick a base period and compute the percent
change in value from that base period for each subsequent period.
Indexing time series data with SQL can be done with a combination of
aggregations and window functions, or self-JOINs. As an example, we index
women’s clothing store sales to the first year in the series, 1992. The first step is
to aggregate the sales by sales_year in a subquery, as we’ve done
previously. In the outer query, the first_value window function finds the
value associated with the first row in the PARTITION BY clause, according to the
sort in the ORDER BY clause. In this example, we can omit the PARTITION BY
clause, because we want to return the sales value for the first row in the entire
data set returned by the subquery:
SELECT sales_year, sales
,first_value(sales) over (order by sales_year) as index_sales
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
    ,sum(sales) as sales
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
    GROUP BY 1
) a

## Page 127

;
sales_year  sales  index_sales
----------  -----  -----------
1992.0      31815  31815
1993.0      32350  31815
1994.0      30585  31815
...         ...    ...
With this sample of data, we can visually verify that the index value is correctly
set at the value for 1992. Next, find the percent change from this base year for
each row:
SELECT sales_year, sales
,(sales / first_value(sales) over (order by sales_year) - 1) * 100 
 as pct_from_index
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
    ,sum(sales) as sales
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
    GROUP BY 1
) a
;
sales_year  sales  pct_from_index
----------  -----  --------------
1992.0      31815  0
1993.0      32350  1.681596731101
1994.0      30585  -3.86610089580
...         ...    ...
The percent change can be either positive or negative, and we’ll see that does in
fact occur in this time series. The last_value window function could be
substituted for first_value in this query. Indexing from the last value in a
series is much less common, however, since analysis questions more often relate
to change from a starting point rather than looking back from an arbitrary ending
point; still, the option is there. Additionally, the sort order can be used to achieve
indexing from the first or last value by switching between ASC and DESC:
first_value(sales) over (order by sales_year desc)

## Page 128

Window functions provide a lot of flexibility. Indexing can be accomplished
without them through a series of self-JOINs, though more lines of code are
required:
SELECT sales_year, sales
,(sales / index_sales - 1) * 100 as pct_from_index
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('year',aa.sales_month) as sales_year
    ,bb.index_sales
    ,sum(aa.sales) as sales
    FROM retail_sales aa
    JOIN 
    (
        SELECT first_year, sum(a.sales) as index_sales
        FROM retail_sales a
        JOIN 
        (
            SELECT min(date_part('year',sales_month)) as first_year
            FROM retail_sales
            WHERE kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
        ) b on date_part('year',a.sales_month) = b.first_year 
        WHERE a.kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
        GROUP BY 1
    ) bb on 1 = 1
    WHERE aa.kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
    GROUP BY 1,2
) aaa
;
sales_year  sales  pct_from_index
----------  -----  --------------
1992.0      31815  0
1993.0      32350  1.681596731101
1994.0      30585  -3.86610089580
...         ...    ...
Notice the unusual JOIN clause on 1 = 1 between alias aa and subquery bb.
Since we want the index_sales value to populate for every row in the result
set, we can’t JOIN on the year or any other value, which would restrict the
results. However, the database will return an error if no JOIN clause is specified.
We can fool the database by using any expression that evaluates to TRUE in
order to create the desired Cartesian JOIN. Any other TRUE statement, such as
on 2 = 2 or on 'apples' = 'apples', could be used instead.

## Page 129

WARNING
Beware of zeros in the denominator of division operations such as sales / index_sales
in the last example. Databases return an error when they encounter division by zero, which can
be frustrating. Even when you think a zero in the denominator field is unlikely, it’s good
practice to prevent this by telling the database to return an alternate default value when it
encounters a zero. This can be done with a CASE statement. The examples in this section do
not have zeros in the denominator, so I will omit this extra code for the sake of legibility.
To wrap up this section, let’s look at a graph of the indexed time series for men’s
and women’s clothing stores, shown in Figure 3-11. The SQL code looks like:
SELECT sales_year, kind_of_business, sales
,(sales / first_value(sales) over (partition by kind_of_business 
                                   order by sales_year)
 - 1) * 100 as pct_from_index
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
    ,kind_of_business
    ,sum(sales) as sales
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE kind_of_business in ('Men''s clothing stores'
     ,'Women''s clothing stores')
    and sales_month <= '2019-12-31'
    GROUP BY 1,2
) a
;

## Page 131

Figure 3-11. Men’s and women’s clothing store sales, indexed to 1992 sales
It’s apparent from this graph that 1992 was something of a high-water mark for
sales at men’s clothing stores. After 1992 sales dropped, then returned briefly to
the same level in 1998, and have been declining ever since. This is striking since
the data set is not adjusted for inflation, the tendency for prices to rise over time.
Sales at women’s clothing stores decreased from 1992 levels initially, but they
returned to the 1992 level by 2003. They have increased since, with the
exception of the drop during the financial crisis that decreased sales in 2009 and
2010. One explanation for these trends is that men simply decreased spending on
clothes over time, perhaps becoming less fashion conscious relative to women.
Perhaps men’s clothing simply became less expensive as global supply chains
decreased costs. Yet another explanation might be that men shifted their clothing
purchases from retailers categorized as “men’s clothing stores” to other types of
retailers, such as sporting goods stores or online retailers.
Indexing time series data is a powerful analysis technique, allowing us to find a
range of insights in the data. SQL is well suited to this task, and I’ve shown how
to construct indexed time series with and without window functions. Next, I’ll
show you how to analyze data by using rolling time windows to find patterns in
noisy time series.
Rolling Time Windows
Time series data is often noisy, a challenge for one of our primary goals of
finding patterns. We’ve seen how aggregating data, such as from monthly to
yearly, can smooth out the results and make them easier to interpret. Another
technique for smoothing data is rolling time windows, also known as moving
calculations, that take into account multiple periods. Moving averages are
probably the most common, but with the power of SQL, any aggregate function
is available for analysis. Rolling time windows are used in a wide variety of
analysis areas, including stock markets, macroeconomic trends, and audience
measurement. Some calculations are so commonly used that they have their own
acronyms: last twelve months (LTM), trailing twelve months (TTM), and year-
to-date (YTD).
Figure 3-12 shows an example of a rolling time window and a cumulative

## Page 132

calculation, relative to the month of October in the time series.

## Page 133

Figure 3-12. Example of LTM and YTD rolling sum of sales
There are several important pieces of any rolling time series calculation. First is
the size of the window, which is the number of periods to include in the
calculation. Larger windows with more time periods have a greater smoothing
effect, but at the risk of losing sensitivity to important short-term changes in the
data. Shorter windows with fewer time periods do less smoothing and thus are
more sensitive to short-term changes, but at the risk of too little noise reduction.
The second piece of time series calculations is the aggregate function used. As
noted previously, moving averages are probably the most common. Moving
sums, counts, minimums, and maximums can also be calculated with SQL.
Moving counts are useful in user population metrics (see the following sidebar).
Moving minimums and maximums can help in understanding the extremes of
the data, useful for planning analyses.
The third piece of time series calculations is choosing the partitioning, or
grouping, of the data that is included in the window. The analysis might call for
resetting the window every year. Or the analysis might need a different moving
series for each component or user group. Chapter 4 will go into more detail on
cohort analysis of user groups, where we will consider how retention and
cumulative values such as spend differ between populations over time.
Partitioning will be controlled through grouping as well as the PARTITION BY
statement of window functions.
With these three pieces in mind, we’ll move into the SQL code and calculations
for moving time periods, continuing with the US retail sales data set for
examples.
MEASURING “ACTIVE USERS”: DAU, WAU, AND MAU
Many consumer and some B2B SaaS applications use active user
calculations such as daily active users (DAU), weekly active users (WAU),
and monthly active users (MAU) to estimate their audience size. Since each
of these are rolling windows, they can be calculated on a daily basis. I’ve
often been asked what is the right or best metric to use, and my answer is
always “it depends.”
DAU helps companies with capacity planning, such as estimating how much

## Page 134

load to expect on servers. Depending on the service, however, even more
detailed data might be needed, such as peak hourly or even minute-by-
minute concurrent user information.
MAU is commonly used to estimate relative sizes of applications or services.
It is useful for measuring fairly stable or growing user populations that have
regular usage patterns that aren’t necessarily daily, such as higher use on the
weekend for leisure products, or higher weekday use for work- or school-
related products. MAU is not as well suited to detecting changes in
underlying churn from users who stop using an application. Since it takes a
user 30 days, the most common window, to pass through MAU, a user can
have been absent from the product for 29 days before they trigger a drop in
MAU.
WAU, calculated over 7 days, can be a happy medium between DAU and
MAU. WAU is more sensitive to short-term fluctuations, alerting teams to
changes in churn more quickly than MAU while smoothing over day of
week fluctuations that are tracked by DAU. A drawback to WAU is that it is
still sensitive to short-term fluctuations driven by events such as holidays.
Calculating Rolling Time Windows
Now that we know what rolling time windows are, how they’re useful, and their
key components, let’s get into calculating them using the US retail sales data set.
We’ll start with the simpler case, when the data set contains a record for each
period that should be in the window, and then in the next section we’ll look at
what to do when this is not the case.
There are two main methods for calculating a rolling time window: a self-JOIN,
which can be used in any database, and a window function, which as we’ve seen
isn’t available in some databases. In both cases we need the same result: a date
and a number of data points that corresponds to the size of the window to which
we will apply an average or another aggregate function.
For this example, we’ll use a window of 12 months to get rolling annual sales,
since the data is at a monthly level of granularity. We’ll then apply an average to
get a 12-month moving average of retail sales. First, let’s develop the intuition
for what will go into the calculation. In this query, alias a of the table is our

## Page 135

“anchor” table, the one from which we gather the dates. To start, we’ll look at a
single month, December 2019. From alias b, the query gathers the 12 individual
months of sales that will go into the moving average. This is accomplished with
the JOIN clause b.sales_month between a.sales_month -
interval '11 months' and a.sales_month, which creates an
intentional Cartesian JOIN:
SELECT a.sales_month
,a.sales
,b.sales_month as rolling_sales_month
,b.sales as rolling_sales
FROM retail_sales a
JOIN retail_sales b on a.kind_of_business = b.kind_of_business 
 and b.sales_month between a.sales_month - interval '11 months' 
 and a.sales_month
 and b.kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
WHERE a.kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
and a.sales_month = '2019-12-01'
;
sales_month  sales  rolling_sales_month  rolling_sales
-----------  -----  -------------------  -------------
2019-12-01   4496   2019-01-01           2511

2019-12-01   4496   2019-05-01           3807
2019-12-01   4496   2019-06-01           3272
2019-12-01   4496   2019-07-01           3261
2019-12-01   4496   2019-08-01           3325
2019-12-01   4496   2019-09-01           3080
2019-12-01   4496   2019-10-01           3390
2019-12-01   4496   2019-11-01           3850
2019-12-01   4496   2019-12-01           4496
Notice that the sales_month and sales figures from alias a are repeated for
each row of the 12 months in the window.
WARNING
Remember that the dates in a BETWEEN clause are inclusive (both will be returned in the
result set). It’s a common mistake to use 12 instead of 11 in the preceding query. When in
doubt, check the intermediate query results as I’ve done here to make sure the intended number
of periods ends up in the window calculation.

## Page 136

The next step is to apply the aggregation—in this case, avg, since we want a
rolling average. The count of records returned from alias b is included to
confirm that each row averages 12 data points, a useful data quality check. Alias
a also has a filter on sales_month. Since this data set starts in 1992, months
in that year, except for December, have fewer than 12 historical records:
SELECT a.sales_month
,a.sales
,avg(b.sales) as moving_avg
,count(b.sales) as records_count
FROM retail_sales a
JOIN retail_sales b on a.kind_of_business = b.kind_of_business 
 and b.sales_month between a.sales_month - interval '11 months' 
 and a.sales_month
 and b.kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
WHERE a.kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
and a.sales_month >= '1993-01-01'
GROUP BY 1,2
;
sales_month  sales  moving_avg  records_count
-----------  -----  ----------  -------------
1993-01-01   2123   2672.08     12
1993-02-01   2005   2673.25     12
1993-03-01   2442   2676.50     12
...          ...    ...         ...
The results are graphed in Figure 3-13. While the monthly trend is noisy, the
smoothed moving average trend makes detecting changes such as the increase
from 2003 to 2007 and the subsequent dip through 2011 easier to spot. Notice
that the extreme drop in early 2020 pulls the moving average down even after
sales start to rebound later in the year.

TIP
Adding the filter kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores' to each
alias isn’t strictly necessary. Since the query uses an INNER JOIN, filtering on one table will

## Page 138

automatically filter on the other. However, filtering on both tables often makes queries run
faster, particularly when the tables are large.
Window functions are another way to calculate rolling time windows. To make a
rolling window, we need to use another optional part of a window calculation:
the frame clause. The frame clause allows you to specify which records to
include in the window. By default, all records in the partition are included, and
for many cases this works just fine. However, controlling the included records at
a more fine-grained level is useful for cases like moving window calculations.
The syntax is simple and yet can be confusing when encountering it for the first
time. The frame clause can be specified as:
{ RANGE | ROWS | GROUPS } BETWEEN frame_start AND frame_end
Within the curly braces are three options for the frame type: range, rows, and
groups. These are the ways you can specify which records to include in the
result, relative to the current row. Records are always chosen from the current
partition and follow the ORDER BY specified. The default sorting is ascending
(ASC), but it can be changed to descending (DESC). Rows is the most
straightforward and will allow you to specify the exact number of rows that
should be returned. Range includes records that are within some boundary of
values relative to the current row. Groups can be used when there are multiple
records with the same ORDER BY value, such as when a data set includes
multiple lines per sales month, one for each customer.
The frame_start and frame_end can be any of the following:
UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
offset PRECEDING
CURRENT ROW
offset FOLLOWING
UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
Preceding means to include rows before the current row, according to the
ORDER BY sorting. Current row is just that, and following means to include
rows that occur after the current row according to the ORDER BY sorting. The
UNBOUNDED keyword means to include all records in the partition before or

## Page 139

after the current row. The offset is the number of records, often just an integer
constant, though a field or an expression that returns an integer could also be
used. Frame clauses also have an optional frame_exclusion option, which is
beyond the scope of the discussion here. Figure 3-14 shows an example of the
rows that each of the window frame options will pick up.

## Page 140

Figure 3-14. Window frame clauses and the rows they include

## Page 141

From partition to ordering to window frames, window functions have a variety
of options that control the calculations, making them incredibly powerful and
well suited to tackling complex calculations with relatively simple syntax.
Returning to our retail sales example, the moving average that we calculated
using a self-JOIN can be accomplished with window functions in fewer lines of
code:
SELECT sales_month
,avg(sales) over (order by sales_month 
                  rows between 11 preceding and current row
                  ) as moving_avg
,count(sales) over (order by sales_month 
                  rows between 11 preceding and current row
                  ) as records_count
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
;
sales_month  moving_avg  records_count
-----------  ----------  -------------
1992-01-01   1873.00     1
1992-02-01   1932.00     2
1992-03-01   2089.00     3
...          ...         ...
1993-01-01   2672.08     12
1993-02-01   2673.25     12
1993-03-01   2676.50     12
...          ...         ...
In this query, the window orders the sales by month (ascending) to ensure that
the window records are in chronological order.  The frame clause is rows
between 11 preceding and current row, since I know that I have
one record for each month and I want the 11 prior months and the month from
the current row included in the average and count calculations. The query returns
all months, including those that don’t have 11 prior months, and we might want
to filter these out by placing this query in a subquery and filtering by month or
number of records in the outer query.
TIP
While calculating moving averages from prior time periods is common in many business
contexts, SQL window functions are flexible enough to include future time periods as well.

## Page 142

They can also be used in any scenario in which the data has some ordering, not just in time
series analysis.
Calculating rolling averages or other moving aggregations can be accomplished
with self-JOINs or window functions when records exist in the data set for each
time period in the window. There may be performance differences between the
two methods, depending on the type of database and the size of the data set.
Unfortunately, it’s difficult to predict which one will be performant or to give
general advice on which to use. It’s worth trying both methods and paying
attention to how long it takes to return your query results; then make whichever
one seems to run faster your default choice. Now that we’ve seen how to
calculate rolling time windows, I’ll show how to calculate rolling windows with
sparse data sets.
Rolling Time Windows with Sparse Data
Data sets in the real world may not contain a record for every time period that
falls within the window. The measurement of interest might be seasonal or
intermittent by nature. For example, customers might return to purchase from a
website at irregular intervals, or a particular product might go in and out of
stock. This results in sparse data.
In the last section, I showed how to calculate a rolling window with a self-JOIN
and a date interval in the JOIN clause. You might be thinking that this will pick
up any records within the 12-month time window, whether all were in the data
set or not, and you’d be correct. The problem with this approach comes when
there is no record for the month (or day or year) itself. For example, imagine I
want to calculate the rolling 12-month sales for each model of shoe my store
stocks as of December 2019. Some of the shoes went out of stock prior to
December, however, and so don’t have sales records in that month. Using a self-
JOIN or window function will return a data set of rolling sales for all the shoes
that sold in December, but the data will be missing the shoes that went out of
stock. Fortunately, we have a way to solve this problem: by using a date
dimension.
The date dimension, a static table that contains a row for each calendar date, was
introduced in Chapter 2. With such a table we can ensure that a query returns a

## Page 143

result for every date of interest, whether or not there was a data point for that
date in the underlying data set. Since the retail_sales data does include
rows for all months, I’ve simulated a sparse data set by adding a subquery to
filter the table to only sales_months from January and July (1 and 7). Let’s
look at the results when JOINed to the date_dim, but before aggregation, to
develop intuition about the data before applying calculations:
SELECT a.date, b.sales_month, b.sales
FROM date_dim a
JOIN 
(
    SELECT sales_month, sales
    FROM retail_sales 
    WHERE kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
     and date_part('month',sales_month) in (1,7)
) b on b.sales_month between a.date - interval '11 months' and a.date
WHERE a.date = a.first_day_of_month
 and a.date between '1993-01-01' and '2020-12-01'
;
date        sales_month  sales
----------  -----------  -----
1993-01-01  1992-07-01   2373
1993-01-01  1993-01-01   2123
1993-02-01  1992-07-01   2373
1993-02-01  1993-01-01   2123
1993-03-01  1992-07-01   2373
...         ...          ...
Notice that the query returns results for February and March dates in addition
to January, even though there are no sales for these months in the subquery
results. This is possible because the date dimension contains records for all
months. The filter a.date = a.first_day_of_month restricts the result
set to one value per month, instead of the 28 to 31 rows per month that would
result from joining to every date. The construction of this query is otherwise
very similar to the self-JOIN query in the last section, with the JOIN clause on
b.sales_month between a.date - interval '11 months'
and a.date of the same form as the JOIN clause in the self-JOIN. Now that
we have developed an understanding of what the query will return, we can go
ahead and apply the avg aggregation to get the moving average:

## Page 144

SELECT a.date
,avg(b.sales) as moving_avg
,count(b.sales) as records
FROM date_dim a
JOIN 
(
    SELECT sales_month, sales
    FROM retail_sales 
    WHERE kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
     and date_part('month',sales_month) in (1,7)
) b on b.sales_month between a.date - interval '11 months' and a.date
WHERE a.date = a.first_day_of_month
 and a.date between '1993-01-01' and '2020-12-01'
GROUP BY 1
;
date        moving_avg  records
----------  ----------  -------
1993-01-01  2248.00     2
1993-02-01  2248.00     2
1993-03-01  2248.00     2
...         ...         ...
As we saw above, the result set includes a row for every month; however, the
moving average stays constant until a new data point (in this case, a January or
July) is added. Each moving average consists of two underlying data points. In a
real use case, the number of underlying data points is likely to vary. To return the
current month’s value when using a data dimension, an aggregation with a
CASE statement can be used—for example:
,max(case when a.date = b.sales_month then b.sales end) 
 as sales_in_month
The conditions inside the CASE statement can be changed to return any of the
underlying records that the analysis requires through use of equality, inequality,
or offsets with date math. If a date dimension is not available in your database,
then another technique can be used to simulate one. In a subquery, SELECT the
DISTINCT dates needed and JOIN them to your table in the same way as in the
preceding examples:
SELECT a.sales_month, avg(b.sales) as moving_avg
FROM
(

## Page 145

SELECT distinct sales_month
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE sales_month between '1993-01-01' and '2020-12-01'
) a
JOIN retail_sales b on b.sales_month between 
 a.sales_month - interval '11 months' and a.sales_month
 and b.kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores' 
GROUP BY 1
;
sales_month  moving_avg
-----------  ----------
1993-01-01   2672.08
1993-02-01   2673.25
1993-03-01   2676.50
...          ...
In this example, I used the same underlying table because I know it contains all
the months. However, in practice any database table that contains the needed
dates can be used, whether or not it is related to the table from which you want
to calculate the rolling aggregation.
Calculating rolling time windows with sparse or missing data can be done in
SQL with controlled application of Cartesian JOINs. Next, we’ll look at how to
calculate cumulative values that are often used in analysis.
Calculating Cumulative Values
Rolling window calculations, such as moving averages, typically use fixed-size
windows, such as 12 months, as we saw in the last section.  Another commonly
used type of calculation is the cumulative value, such as YTD, quarter-to-date
(QTD), and month-to-date (MTD). Rather than a fixed-length window, these rely
on a common starting point, with the window size growing with each row.
The simplest way to calculate cumulative values is with a window function. In
this example, sum is used to find total sales YTD as of each month. Other
analyses might call for a monthly average YTD or a monthly maximum YTD,
which can be accomplished by swapping sum for avg or max. The window
resets according to the PARTITION BY clause, in this case the year of the sales
month. The ORDER BY clause typically includes a date field in time series
analysis. Omitting the ORDER BY can lead to incorrect results due to the way

## Page 146

the data is sorted in the underlying table, so it’s a good idea to include it even if
you think the data is already sorted by date:
SELECT sales_month, sales
,sum(sales) over (partition by date_part('year',sales_month) 
                  order by sales_month
                  ) as sales_ytd
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
;
sales_month  sales  sales_ytd
-----------  -----  ---------
1992-01-01   1873   1873
1992-02-01   1991   3864
1992-03-01   2403   6267
...          ...    ...
1992-12-01   4416   31815
1993-01-01   2123   2123
1993-02-01   2005   4128
...          ...    ...
The query returns a record for each sales_month, the sales for that month,
and the running total sales_ytd. The series starts in 1992 and then resets in
January 1993, as it will for every year in the data set. The results for years 2016
through 2020 are graphed in Figure 3-15. The first four years show similar
patterns through the year, but of course 2020 looks very different.

## Page 147

Figure 3-15. Monthly sales and cumulative annual sales for women’s clothing stores
The same results can be achieved without window functions, by using a self-
JOIN that leverages a Cartesian JOIN. In this example, the two table aliases are
JOINed on the year of the sales_month to ensure that the aggregated values

## Page 148

are for the same year, resetting each year. The JOIN clause also specifies that the
results should include sales_months from alias b that are less than or equal
to the sales_month in alias a. In January 1992, only the January 1992 row
from alias b meets this criterion; in February 1992, both January and February
1992 do; and so on:
SELECT a.sales_month, a.sales
,sum(b.sales) as sales_ytd
FROM retail_sales a
JOIN retail_sales b on 
 date_part('year',a.sales_month) = date_part('year',b.sales_month)
 and b.sales_month <= a.sales_month
 and b.kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
WHERE a.kind_of_business = 'Women''s clothing stores'
GROUP BY 1,2
;
sales_month  sales  sales_ytd

Window functions require fewer characters of code, and it’s usually easier to
keep track of exactly what they are calculating once you are familiar with the
syntax. There’s often more than one way to approach a problem in SQL, and
rolling time windows are a good example of that. I find it useful to know
multiple approaches, because every once in a while I run into a tricky problem
that is actually better solved with an approach that seems less efficient in other
contexts. Now that we’ve covered rolling time windows, we’ll move on to our
final topic in time series analysis with SQL: seasonality.
Analyzing with Seasonality
Seasonality is any pattern that repeats over regular intervals. Unlike other noise

## Page 149

in the data, seasonality can be predicted. The word seasonality brings to mind
the four seasons of the year—spring, summer, fall, winter—and some data sets
include these patterns. Shopping patterns change with the seasons, from the
clothes and food people buy to the money spent on leisure and travel. The winter
holiday shopping season can be make-or-break for many retailers. Seasonality
can also exist at other time scales, from years down to minutes. Presidential
elections in the United States happen every four years, leading to distinct
patterns in media coverage.  Day of week cyclicality is common, as work and
school dominate Monday to Friday, while chores and leisure activities dominate
the weekend. Time of day is another type of seasonality that restaurants
experience, with rushes around lunch and dinner time and slower sales in
between.
To understand whether seasonality exists in a time series, and at what scale, it’s
useful to graph it and then visually inspect for patterns. Try aggregating at
different levels, from hourly to daily, weekly, and monthly. You should also
incorporate knowledge about the data set. Are there patterns that you can guess
based on what you know about the entity or process it represents? Consult
subject matter experts, if available.
Let’s take a look at some seasonal patterns in the retail sales data set, shown in
Figure 3-16. Jewelry stores have a highly seasonal pattern, with annual peaks in
December related to holiday gift giving. Book stores have two peaks each year:
one peak is in August, corresponding with back-to-school time in the United
States; the other peak starts in December and lasts through January, including
both the holiday gift period and back-to-school time for the spring semester. A
third example is grocery stores, which have much less monthly seasonality than
the other two time series (although they likely have seasonality at the day of
week and time of day level). This isn’t surprising: people need to eat year-round.
Grocery store sales increase a bit in December for the holidays, and they decline
in February, since that month simply has fewer days.

## Page 150

Figure 3-16. Examples of seasonality patterns in book store, grocery store, and jewelry store sales
Seasonality can take many forms, though there are some common approaches to
analyzing it regardless. One way to deal with seasonality is to smooth it out,
either by aggregating the data to a less granular time period or by using rolling

## Page 151

windows, as we saw previously. Another way to work with seasonal data is to
benchmark against similar time periods and analyze the difference. I’ll show
several ways to accomplish this next.
Period-over-Period Comparisons: YoY and MoM
Period-over-period comparisons can take multiple forms. The first one is to
compare a time period to the previous value in the series, a practice so common
in analysis that there are acronyms for the most often-used comparisons.
Depending on the level of aggregation the comparison might be year-over-year
(YoY), month-over-month (MoM), day-over-day (DoD), and so on.
For these calculations we’ll use the lag function, another one of the window
functions. The lag function returns a previous or lagging value from a series.
The lag function has the following form:
lag(return_value [,offset [,default]])
The return_value is any field from the data set and thus can be any data
type. The optional OFFSET indicates how many rows back in the partition to
take the return_value from. The default is 1, but any integer value can be
used. You can also optionally specify a default value to use if there is no
lagging record to retrieve a value from. Like other window functions, lag is
also calculated over a partition, with sorting determined by the ORDER BY
clause. If no PARTITION BY clause is specified, lag looks back over the whole
data set, and likewise if no ORDER BY clause is specified, the database order is
used. It’s usually a good idea to at least include an ORDER BY clause in a lag
window function to control the output.
TIP
The lead window function works in the same way as the lag function, except that it returns
a subsequent value as determined by the offset. Changing the ORDER BY from ascending
(ASC) to descending (DESC) in a time series has the effect of turning a lag statement into the
equivalent of a lead statement. Alternatively, a negative integer can be used as the OFFSET
value to return a value from a subsequent row.

## Page 152

Let’s apply this to our retail sales data set to calculate MoM and YoY growth. In
this section, we’ll focus on book store sales, since I’m a real book store nerd.
First, we’ll develop our intuition about what is returned by the lag function by
returning both the lagging month and the lagging sales values:
SELECT kind_of_business, sales_month, sales
,lag(sales_month) over (partition by kind_of_business 
                        order by sales_month
                        ) as prev_month
,lag(sales) over (partition by kind_of_business 
                  order by sales_month
                  ) as prev_month_sales
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Book stores'
;
kind_of_business  sales_month  sales  prev_month  prev_month_sales
----------------  -----------  -----  ----------  ----------------
Book stores       1992-01-01   790    (null)      (null)
Book stores       1992-02-01   539    1992-01-01  790
Book stores       1992-03-01   535    1992-02-01  539
...               ...          ...    ...         ...
For each row, the previous sales_month is returned, as well as the sales for
that month, and we can confirm this by inspecting the first few lines of the result
set. The first row has null for prev_month and prev_month_sales since
there is no earlier record in this data set. With an understanding of the values
returned by the lag function, we can calculate the percent change from the
previous value:
SELECT kind_of_business, sales_month, sales
,(sales / lag(sales) over (partition by kind_of_business 
                           order by sales_month)
 - 1) * 100 as pct_growth_from_previous
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Book stores'
;
kind_of_business  sales_month  sales  pct_growth_from_previous
----------------  -----------  -----  ------------------------
Book stores       1992-01-01   790    (null)
Book stores       1992-02-01   539    -31.77
Book stores       1992-03-01   535    -0.74
...               ...          ...    ...

## Page 153

Sales dropped 31.8% from January to February, due at least in part to the
seasonal decline after the holidays and the return to school for the spring
semester. Sales were down only 0.7% from February to March.
The calculation for the YoY comparison is similar, but first we need to aggregate
sales to the yearly level. Since we’re looking at only one
kind_of_business, I’ll drop that field from the rest of the examples to
simplify the code:
SELECT sales_year, yearly_sales
,lag(yearly_sales) over (order by sales_year) as prev_year_sales
,(yearly_sales / lag(yearly_sales) over (order by sales_year)
 -1) * 100 as pct_growth_from_previous
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('year',sales_month) as sales_year
    ,sum(sales) as yearly_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE kind_of_business = 'Book stores'
    GROUP BY 1
) a
;
sales_year  yearly_sales  prev_year_sales  pct_growth_from_previous
----------  ------------  ---------------  ------------------------
1992.0      8327          (null)           (null)
1993.0      9108          8327             9.37
1994.0      10107         9108             10.96
...         ...           ...              ...
Sales grew more than 9.3% from 1992 to 1993, and almost 11% from 1993 to
1994. These period-over-period calculations are useful, but they don’t quite
allow us to analyze the seasonality in the data set. For example, in Figure 3-17
the MoM percent growth values are plotted, and they contain just as much
seasonality as the original time series.

## Page 154

Figure 3-17. Percent growth from previous month for US retail book store sales
To tackle this, the next section will demonstrate how to use SQL to compare
current values to the values for the same month in the previous year.

## Page 155

Period-over-Period Comparisons: Same Month Versus Last
Year
Comparing data for one time period to data for a similar previous time period
can be a useful way to control for seasonality. The previous time period may be
the same day of the week in the previous week, the same month in the previous
year, or another variation that makes sense for the data set.
To accomplish this comparison, we can use the lag function along with some
clever partitioning: the unit of time with which we want to compare the current
value. In this case, we will compare monthly sales to the sales for the same
month in the previous year. For example, January sales will be compared to
prior year January sales, February sales will be compared to prior year
February sales, and so on.
First, recall that the date_part function returns a numeric value when used
with the “month” argument:
SELECT sales_month
,date_part('month',sales_month)
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Book stores'
;
sales_month  date_part
-----------  ---------
1992-01-01   1.0
1992-02-01   2.0
1992-03-01   3.0
...          ...
Next, we include the date_part in the PARTITION BY clause so that the
window function looks up the value for the matching month number from the
prior year.
This is an example of how window function clauses can include calculations in
addition to database fields, giving them even more versatility. I find it useful to
check intermediate results to build intuition about what the final query will
return, so first we’ll confirm that the lag function with partition by
date_part('mon⁠th',sales_month) returns the intended values:

## Page 156

SELECT sales_month, sales
,lag(sales_month) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month) 
                        order by sales_month
                        ) as prev_year_month
,lag(sales) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month) 
                  order by sales_month
                  ) as prev_year_sales
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Book stores'
;

The first lag function returns the same month for the prior year, which we can
verify by looking at the prev_year_month value. The row for the 1993-01-
01 sales_month returns 1992-01-01 for the prev_year_month as
intended, and the prev_year_sales of 790 match the sales we can see in
the 1992-01-01 row. Notice that the prev_year_month and
prev_year_sales are null for 1992 since there are no prior records in the
data set.
Now that we’re confident the lag function as written returns the correct values,
we can calculate comparison metrics such as absolute difference and percent
change from previous:
SELECT sales_month, sales
,sales - lag(sales) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month) 
                          order by sales_month
                          ) as absolute_diff
,(sales / lag(sales) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month)
                          order by sales_month)
 - 1) * 100 as pct_diff
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Book stores'
;

We can now graph the results in Figure 3-18 and more easily see the months
where growth was unusually high, such as January 2002, or unusually low, such
as December 2001.

## Page 158

Another useful analysis tool is to create a graph that lines up the same time
period—in this case, months—with a line for each time series—in this case,
years. To do this, we’ll create a result set that has a row for each month number

## Page 159

or name, and a column for each of the years we want to consider. To get the
month, we can use either the date_part or the to_char function, depending
on whether we want numeric or text values for the months. Then we’ll pivot the
data using an aggregate function.
This example uses the max aggregate, but depending on the analysis, a sum,
count, or other aggregation might be appropriate. We’ll zoom in on 1992
through 1994 for this example:
SELECT date_part('month',sales_month) as month_number
,to_char(sales_month,'Month') as month_name
,max(case when date_part('year',sales_month) = 1992 then sales end) 
 as sales_1992
,max(case when date_part('year',sales_month) = 1993 then sales end) 
 as sales_1993
,max(case when date_part('year',sales_month) = 1994 then sales end) 
 as sales_1994
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Book stores'
 and sales_month between '1992-01-01' and '1994-12-01'

12.0          December    1165        1273        1409
By lining the data up in this way, we can see some trends immediately.
December sales are the highest monthly sales of the year. Sales in 1994 were
higher every month than sales in 1992 and 1993. The August-to-September sales
bump is visible, and particularly easy to spot in 1994.
With a graph of the data, as in Figure 3-19, the trends are much easier to identify.

## Page 160

Sales increased year to year in every month, though the increases were larger in
some months than others. With this data and graph in hand, we can start to
construct a story about book store sales that might help with inventory planning
or scheduling of marketing promotions or might serve as a piece of evidence in a
wider story about US retail sales.
With SQL there are a number of techniques for cutting through the noise of
seasonality to compare data in time series. In this section, we’ve seen how to
compare current values to prior comparable periods using lag functions and
how to pivot the data with date_part, to_char, and aggregate functions.
Next, I’ll show some techniques for comparing multiple prior periods in order to
further control for noisy time series data.

## Page 162

Figure 3-19. Book store sales for 1992–1994, aligned by month
Comparing to Multiple Prior Periods
Comparing data to prior comparable periods is a useful way to reduce the noise
that arises from seasonality. Sometimes comparing to a single prior period is
insufficient, particularly if that prior period was impacted by unusual events.
Comparing a Monday to the previous Monday is difficult if one of them was a
holiday. The month in the prior year might be unusual due to economic events,
severe weather, or a site outage that changed typical behavior. Comparing
current values to an aggregate of multiple prior periods can help smooth out
these fluctuations. These techniques also combine what we’ve learned about
using SQL to calculate rolling time periods and comparable prior period results.
The first technique uses the lag function, as in the last section, but here we’ll
take advantage of the optional offset value. Recall that when no offset is
provided to lag, the function returns the immediate prior value according to the
PARTITION BY and ORDER BY clauses. An offset value of 2 skips over the
immediate prior value and returns the value prior to that, an offset value of 3
returns the value from 3 rows back, and so on.
For this example, we’ll compare the current month’s sales to the same month’s
sales over three prior years. As usual, first we’ll inspect the returned values to
confirm the SQL is working as expected:
SELECT sales_month, sales
,lag(sales,1) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month) 
                    order by sales_month
                    ) as prev_sales_1
,lag(sales,2) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month) 
                    order by sales_month
                    ) as prev_sales_2
,lag(sales,3) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month) 
                    order by sales_month
                    ) as prev_sales_3
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Book stores'
;
sales_month  sales  prev_sales_1  prev_sales_2  prev_sales_3

Null is returned where no prior record exists, and we can confirm that the correct
same month, prior year value appears. From here we can calculate whatever
comparison metric the analysis calls for—in this case, the percent of the rolling
average of three prior periods:
SELECT sales_month, sales
,sales / ((prev_sales_1 + prev_sales_2 + prev_sales_3) / 3) 
 as pct_of_3_prev
FROM
(
    SELECT sales_month, sales
    ,lag(sales,1) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month) 
                        order by sales_month
                        ) as prev_sales_1
    ,lag(sales,2) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month) 
                        order by sales_month
                        ) as prev_sales_2
    ,lag(sales,3) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month) 
                        order by sales_month
                        ) as prev_sales_3
    FROM retail_sales
    WHERE kind_of_business = 'Book stores'
) a

...          ...    ...
We can see from the result that book sales grew from the prior three-year rolling
average in the mid-1990s, but the picture was different in the late 2010s, when
sales were a shrinking percentage of that three-year rolling average each year.

## Page 164

You might have noticed that this problem resembles one we saw earlier when
calculating rolling time windows. As an alternative to the last example, we can
use an avg window function with a frame clause. To accomplish this, the
PARTITION BY will use the same date_part function, and the ORDER BY is
the same. A frame clause is added to include rows between 3 preceding
and 1 preceding.  This includes the values in the 1, 2, and 3 rows prior but
excludes the value in the current row:
SELECT sales_month, sales
,sales / avg(sales) over (partition by date_part('month',sales_month)
                          order by sales_month
                          rows between 3 preceding and 1 preceding
                          ) as pct_of_prev_3
FROM retail_sales
WHERE kind_of_business = 'Book stores'
;
sales_month  sales  pct_of_prev_3

2019-01-01   1004   74.73
...          ...    ...
The results match those of the previous example, confirming that the alternative
code is equivalent.
TIP
If you look closely, you’ll notice that the decimal place values are slightly different in the
result using the three lag windows and the result using the avg window function. This is due
to how the database handles decimal rounding in intermediate calculations. For many analyses,
the difference won’t matter, but pay careful attention if you’re working with financial or other
highly regulated data.
Analyzing data with seasonality often involves trying to reduce noise in order to
make clear conclusions about the underlying trends in the data. Comparing data

## Page 165

points against multiple prior time periods can give us an even smoother trend to
compare to and determine what is actually happening in the current time period.
This does require that the data include enough history to make these
comparisons, but when we have a long enough time series, it can be insightful.
Conclusion
Time series analysis is a powerful way to analyze data sets. We’ve seen how to
set up our data for analysis with date and time manipulations. We talked about
date dimensions and saw how to apply them to calculating rolling time windows.
We looked at period-over-period calculations and how to analyze data with
seasonality patterns. In the next chapter, we’ll delve deep into a related topic that
extends on time series analysis: cohort analysis.
1  October and November 2020 data points were suppressed by the publisher of the data, due to
concerns about the data quality. Collecting the data likely became more difficult due to store closures
during the 2020 pandemic.

Chapter 4. Cohort Analysis
In Chapter 3 we covered time series analysis. With those techniques in hand, we
will now turn to a related type of analysis with many business and other
applications: cohort analysis.
I remember the first time I encountered a cohort analysis. I was working at my
first data analyst job, at a small startup. I was reviewing a purchase analysis I’d
worked on with the CEO, and he suggested that I break up the customer base by
cohorts to see whether behavior was changing over time. I assumed it was some
fancy business school thing and probably useless, but he was the CEO, so of
course I humored him. Turns out it wasn’t just a lark. Breaking populations into
cohorts and following them over time is a powerful way to analyze your data and
avoid various biases. Cohorts can provide clues to how subpopulations differ
from each other and how they change over time.
In this chapter, we’ll first take a look at what cohorts are and at the building
blocks of certain types of cohort analysis. After an introduction to the legislators
data set used for the examples, we’ll learn how to construct a retention analysis
and deal with various challenges such as defining the cohort and handling sparse
data. Next, we’ll cover survivorship, returnship, and cumulative calculations, all
of which are similar to retention analysis in the way the SQL code is structured.
Finally, we’ll look at how to combine cohort analysis with cross-sectional
analysis to understand the makeup of populations over time.
Cohorts: A Useful Analysis Framework
Before we get into the code, I will define what cohorts are, consider the types of
questions we can answer with this type of analysis, and describe the components
of any cohort analysis.
A cohort is a group of individuals who share some characteristic of interest,
described below, at the time we start observing them. Cohort members are often
people but can be any type of entity we want to study: companies, products, or
physical world phenomena. Individuals in a cohort may be aware of their

## Page 167

membership, just as children in a first-grade class are aware they are part of a
peer group of first graders, or participants in a drug trial are aware they are part
of a group receiving a treatment. At other times, entities are grouped into cohorts
virtually, as when a software company groups all customers acquired in a certain
year to study how long they remain customers. It’s always important to consider
the ethical implications of cohorting entities without their awareness, if any
different treatment is to be applied to them.
Cohort analysis is a useful way to compare groups of entities over time. Many
important behaviors take weeks, months, or years to occur or evolve, and cohort
analysis is a way to understand these changes. Cohort analysis provides a
framework for detecting correlations between cohort characteristics and these
long-term trends, which can lead to hypotheses about the causal drivers. For
example, customers acquired through a marketing campaign may have different
long-term purchase patterns than those who were persuaded by a friend to try a
company’s products. Cohort analysis can be used to monitor new cohorts of
users or customers and assess how they compare to previous cohorts. Such
monitoring can provide an early alert signal that something has gone wrong (or
right) for new customers. Cohort analysis is also used to mine historical data.
A/B tests, discussed in Chapter 7, are the gold standard for determining
causality, but we can’t go back in time and run every test for every question
about the past in which we are interested. We should of course be cautious about
attaching causal meaning to cohort analysis and instead use cohort analysis as a
way to understand customers and generate hypotheses that can be tested
rigorously in the future.
Cohort analyses have three components: the cohort grouping, a time series of
data over which the cohort is observed, and an aggregate metric that measures an
action done by cohort members.
Cohort grouping is often based on a start date: the customer’s first purchase or
subscription date, the date a student started school, and so on. However, cohorts
can also be formed around other characteristics that are either innate or changing
over time. Innate qualities include birth year and country of origin, or the year a
company was founded. Characteristics that can change over time include city of
residence and marital status. When these are used, we need to be careful to
cohort only on the value on the starting date, or else entities can jump between

## Page 168

cohort groups.
COHORT OR SEGMENT?
These two terms are often used in similar ways, or even interchangeably, but it’s worth
drawing a distinction between them for the sake of clarity. A cohort is a group of users (or
other entities) who have a common starting date and are followed over time. A segment is a
grouping of users who share a common characteristic or set of characteristics at a point in time,
regardless of their starting date. Similar to cohorts, segments can be based on innate factors
such as age or on behavioral characteristics. A segment of users that signs up in the same
month can be put into a cohort and followed over time. Or different groupings of users can be
explored with cohort analysis so that you can see which ones have the most valuable
characteristics. The analyses we’ll cover in this chapter, such as retention, can help put
concrete data behind marketing segments.
The second component of any cohort analysis is the time series. This is a series
of purchases, logins, interactions, or other actions that are taken by the
customers or entities to be cohorted. It’s important that the time series covers the
entire life span of the entities, or there will be survivorship bias in early cohorts.
Survivorship bias occurs when only customers who have stayed are in the data
set; churned customers are excluded because they are no longer around, so the
rest of the customers appear to be of higher quality or fit in comparison to newer
cohorts (see “Survivorship Bias”). It’s also important to have a time series that is
long enough for the entities to complete the action of interest. For example, if
customers tend to purchase once a month, a time series of several months is
needed. If, on the other hand, purchases happen only once a year, a time series of
several years would be preferable. Inevitably, more recently acquired customers
will not have had as long to complete actions as those customers who were
acquired further in the past. In order to normalize, cohort analysis usually
measures the number of periods that have elapsed from a starting date, rather
than calendar months. In this way, cohorts can be compared in period 1, period
2, and so on to see how they evolve over time, regardless of which month the
action actually occurred. The intervals may be days, weeks, months, or years.
The aggregate metric should be related to the actions that matter to the health of
the organization, such as customers continuing to use or purchase the product.
Metric values are aggregated across the cohort, usually with sum, count, or
average, though any relevant aggregation works. The result is a time series

## Page 169

that can then be used to understand changes in behavior over time.
In this chapter, I’ll cover four types of cohort analysis: retention, survivorship,
returnship or repeat purchase behavior, and cumulative behavior.
Retention
Retention is concerned with whether the cohort member has a record in the
time series on a particular date, expressed as a number of periods from the
starting date. This is useful in any kind of organization in which repeated
actions are expected, from playing an online game to using a product or
renewing a subscription, and it helps to answer questions about how sticky or
engaging a product is and how many entities can be expected to appear on
future dates.
Survivorship
Survivorship is concerned with how many entities remained in the data set
for a certain length of time or longer, regardless of the number or frequency
of actions up to that time. Survivorship is useful for answering questions
about the proportion of the population that can be expected to remain—either
in a positive sense by not churning or passing away, or in a negative sense by
not graduating or fulfilling some requirement.
Returnship
Returnship or repeat purchase behavior is concerned with whether an action
has happened more than some minimum threshold of times—often simply
more than once—during a fixed window of time. This type of analysis is
useful in situations in which the behavior is intermittent and unpredictable,
such as in retail, where it characterizes the share of repeat purchasers in each
cohort within a fixed time window.
Cumulative

## Page 170

Cumulative calculations are concerned with the total number or amounts
measured at one or more fixed time windows, regardless of when they
happened during that window. Cumulative calculations are often used in
calculations of customer lifetime value (LTV or CLTV).
The four types of cohort analysis allow us to compare subgroups and understand
how they differ over time in order to make better product, marketing, and
financial decisions. The calculations for the different types are similar, so we
will set the stage with retention, and then I’ll show how to modify retention code
to calculate the other types. Before we dive into constructing our cohort analysis,
let’s take a look at the data set we’ll be using for the examples in this chapter.
The Legislators Data Set
The SQL examples in this chapter will use a data set of past and present
members of the United States Congress maintained in a GitHub repository. In
the US, Congress is responsible for writing laws or legislation, so its members
are also known as legislators. Since the data set is a JSON file, I have applied
some transformations to produce a more suitable data model for analysis, and I
have posted data in a format suitable for following along with the examples in
the book’s GitHub legislators folder.
The source repository has an excellent data dictionary, so I won’t repeat all the
details here. I will provide a few details, however, that should help those who
aren’t familiar with the US government to follow along with the analyses in this
chapter.
Congress has two chambers, the Senate (“sen” in the data set) and the House of
Representatives (“rep”). Each state has two senators, and they are elected for six-
year terms. Representatives are allocated to states based on population; each
representative has a district that they alone represent. Representatives are elected
for two-year terms. Actual terms in either chamber can be shorter in the event
that the legislator dies or is elected or appointed to a higher office. Legislators
accumulate power and influence via leadership positions the longer they are in
office, and thus standing for re-election is common. Finally, a legislator may

## Page 171

belong to a political party, or they may be an “independent.” In the modern era,
the vast majority of legislators are Democrats or Republicans, and the rivalry
between the two parties is well known. Legislators occasionally change parties
while in office.
For the analyses, we’ll make use of two tables: legislators and
legislators_terms. The legislators table contains a list of all the
people included in the data set, with birthday, gender, and a set of ID fields that
can be used to look up the person in other data sets. The
legislators_terms table contains a record for each term in office for each
legislator, with start and end date, and other attributes such as chamber and party.
The id_bioguide field is used as the unique identifier of a legislator and
appears in each table. Figure 4-1 shows a sample of the legislators data.
Figure 4-2 shows a sample of the legislators_terms data.
Figure 4-1. Sample of the legislators table

## Page 172

Figure 4-2. Sample of the legislators_terms table
Now that we have an understanding of what cohort analysis is and of the data set
we’ll be using for examples, let’s get into how to write SQL for retention
analysis. The key question SQL will help us answer is: once representatives take
office, how long do they keep their jobs?
Retention
One of the most common types of cohort analysis is retention analysis. To retain
is to keep or continue something. Many skills need to be practiced to be retained.
Businesses usually want their customers to keep purchasing their products or
using their services, since retaining customers is more profitable than acquiring
new ones. Employers want to retain their employees, because recruiting
replacements is expensive and time consuming. Elected officials seek reelection
in order to continue working on the priorities of their constituents.
The main question in retention analysis is whether the starting size of the cohort
—number of subscribers or employees, amount spent, or another key metric—
will remain constant, decay, or increase over time. When there is an increase or a

## Page 173

decrease, the amount and speed of change are also interesting questions. In most
retention analyses, the starting size will tend to decay over time, since a cohort
can lose but cannot gain new members once it is formed. Revenue is an
interesting exception, since a cohort of customers can spend more in subsequent
months than they did in the first month collectively, even if some of them churn.
Retention analysis uses the count of entities or sum of money or actions
present in the data set for each period from the starting date, and it normalizes by
dividing this number by the count or sum of entities, money, or actions in the
first time period. The result is expressed as a percentage, and retention in the
starting period is always 100%. Over time, retention based on counts generally
declines and can never exceed 100%, whereas money- or action-based retention,
while often declining, can increase and be greater than 100% in a time period.
Retention analysis output is typically displayed in either table or graph form,
which is referred to as a retention curve. We’ll see a number of examples of
retention curves later in this chapter.
Graphs of retention curves can be used to compare cohorts. The first
characteristic to pay attention to is the shape of the curve in the initial few
periods, where there is often an initial steep drop. For many consumer apps,
losing half a cohort in the first few months is common. A cohort with a curve
that is either more or less steep than others can indicate changes in the product or
customer acquisition source that merit further investigation. A second
characteristic to look for is whether the curve flattens after some number of
periods or continues declining rapidly to zero. A flattening curve indicates that
there is a point in time from which most of the cohort that remains stays
indefinitely. A retention curve that inflects upward, sometimes called a smile
curve, can occur if cohort members return or reactivate after falling out of the
data set for some period. Finally, retention curves that measure subscription
revenue are monitored for signs of increasing revenue per customer over time, a
sign of a healthy SaaS software business.
This section will show how to create a retention analysis, add cohort groupings
from the time series itself and other tables, and handle missing and sparse data
that can occur in time series data. With this framework in hand, you’ll learn in
the subsequent section how to make modifications to create the other related
types of cohort analysis. As a result, this section on retention will be the longest

## Page 174

one in the chapter, as you build up code and develop your intuition about the
calculations.
SQL for a Basic Retention Curve
For retention analysis, as with other cohort analyses, we need three components:
the cohort definition, a time series of actions, and an aggregate metric that
measures something relevant to the organization or process. In our case, the
cohort members will be the legislators, the time series will be the terms in office
for each legislator, and the metric of interest will be the count of those who are
still in office each period from the starting date. 
We’ll start by calculating basic retention, before moving on to examples that
include various cohort groupings. The first step is to find the first date each
legislator took office (first_term). We will use this date to calculate the
number of periods for each subsequent date in the time series. To do this, take
the min of the term_start and GROUP BY each id_bioguide, the unique
identifier for a legislator:
SELECT id_bioguide
,min(term_start) as first_term
FROM legislators_terms 
GROUP BY 1
;
id_bioguide  first_term
-----------  ----------
A000118      1975-01-14
P000281      1933-03-09
K000039      1933-03-09
...          ...
The next step is to put this code into a subquery and JOIN it to the time series.
The age function is applied to calculate the intervals between each
term_start and the first_term for each legislator. Applying the
date_part functions to the result, with year, transforms this into the number
of yearly periods. Since elections happen every two or six years, we’ll use years
as the time interval to calculate the periods. We could use a shorter interval,
but in this data set there is little fluctuation daily or weekly. The count of

## Page 175

legislators with records for that period is the number retained:
SELECT date_part('year',age(b.term_start,a.first_term)) as period
,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as cohort_retained
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms 
    GROUP BY 1
) a
JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
GROUP BY 1
;
period  cohort_retained
------  ---------------
0.0     12518
1.0     3600
2.0     3619
...     ...
TIP
In databases that support the datediff function, the date_part and age construction can
be replaced by this simpler function:
datediff('year',first_term,term_start)
Some databases, such as Oracle, place the date_part last:
datediff(first_term,term_start,'year'
Now that we have the periods and the number of legislators retained in each, the
final step is to calculate the total cohort_size and populate it in each row so
that the cohort_retained can be divided by it. The first_value
window function returns the first record in the PARTITION BY clause, according
to the ordering set in the ORDER BY, a convenient way to get the cohort size in
each row. In this case, the cohort_size comes from the first record in the
entire data set, so the PARTITION BY is omitted:

## Page 176

first_value(cohort_retained) over (order by period) as cohort_size
To find the percent retained, divide the cohort_retained value by this same
calculation:
SELECT period
,first_value(cohort_retained) over (order by period) as cohort_size
,cohort_retained
,cohort_retained / 
 first_value(cohort_retained) over (order by period) as pct_retained
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('year',age(b.term_start,a.first_term)) as period
    ,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as cohort_retained
    FROM
    (
        SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
        FROM legislators_terms 
        GROUP BY 1
    ) a
    JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
    GROUP BY 1
) aa
;
period  cohort_size  cohort_retained  pct_retained
------  -----------  ---------------  ------------
0.0     12518        12518            1.0000
1.0     12518        3600             0.2876
2.0     12518        3619             0.2891
...     ...          ...              ...
We now have a retention calculation, and we can see that there is a big drop-off
between the 100% of legislators retained in period 0, or on their start date, and
the share with another term record that starts a year later. Graphing the results, as
in Figure 4-3, demonstrates how the curve flattens and eventually goes to zero,
as even the longest-serving legislators eventually retire or die.

## Page 177

We can take the cohort retention result and reshape the data to show it in table
format. Pivot and flatten the results using an aggregate function with a CASE
statement; max is used in this example, but other aggregations such as min or
avg would return the same result. Retention is calculated for years 0 through 4,
but additional years can be added by following the same pattern:
SELECT cohort_size
,max(case when period = 0 then pct_retained end) as yr0
,max(case when period = 1 then pct_retained end) as yr1
,max(case when period = 2 then pct_retained end) as yr2
,max(case when period = 3 then pct_retained end) as yr3
,max(case when period = 4 then pct_retained end) as yr4

    SELECT period
    ,first_value(cohort_retained) over (order by period) 
     as cohort_size

     / first_value(cohort_retained) over (order by period)
     as pct_retained
    FROM
    (

Retention appears to be quite low, and from the graph we can see that it is jagged
in the first few years. One reason for this is that a representative’s term lasts two
years, and senators’ terms last six years, but the data set only contains records for
the start of new terms; thus we are missing data for years in which a legislator
was still in office but did not start a new term. Measuring retention each year is
misleading in this case. One option is to measure retention only on a two- or six-
year cycle, but there is also another strategy we can employ to fill in the
“missing” data. I will cover this next before returning to the topic of forming
cohort groups.
Adjusting Time Series to Increase Retention Accuracy
We discussed techniques for cleaning “missing” data in Chapter 2, and we will
turn to those techniques in this section in order to arrive at a smoother and more
truthful retention curve for the legislators. When working with time series data,
such as in cohort analysis, it’s important to consider not only the data that is
present but also whether that data accurately reflects the presence or absence of
entities at each time period. This is particularly a problem in contexts in which
an event captured in the data leads to the entity persisting for some period of
time that is not captured in the data. For example, a customer buying a software
subscription is represented in the data at the time of the transaction, but that

## Page 179

customer is entitled to use the software for months or years and is not necessarily
represented in the data over that span. To correct for this, we need a way to
derive the span of time in which the entity is still present, either with an explicit
end date or with knowledge of the length of the subscription or term. Then we
can say that the entity was present at any date in between those start and end
dates.
In the legislators data set, we have a record for a term’s start date, but we are
missing the notion that this “entitles” a legislator to serve for two or six years,
depending on the chamber. To correct for this and smooth out the curve, we need
to fill in the “missing” values for the years that legislators are still in office
between new terms. Since this data set includes a term_end value for each
term, I’ll show how to create a more accurate cohort retention analysis by filling
in dates between the start and end values. Then I’ll show how you can impute
end dates when the data set does not include an end date.
Calculating retention using a start and end date defined in the data is the most
accurate approach. For the following examples, we will consider legislators
retained in a particular year if they were still in office as of the last day of the
year, December 31. Prior to the Twentieth Amendment to the US Constitution,
terms began on March 4, but afterward the start date moved to January 3, or to a
subsequent weekday if the third falls on a weekend. Legislators can be sworn in
on other days of the year due to special off-cycle elections or appointments to fill
vacant seats. As a result, term_start dates cluster in January but are spread
across the year. While we could pick another day, December 31 is a strategy for
normalizing around these varying start dates.
The first step is to create a data set that contains a record for each December 31
that each legislator was in office. This can be accomplished by JOINing the
subquery that found the first_term to the legislators_terms table to
find the term_start and term_end for each term. A second JOIN to the
date_dim retrieves the dates that fall between the start and end dates,
restricting the returned values to c.month_name = 'December' and
c.day_of_month = 31. The period is calculated as the years between the
date from the date_dim and the first_term. Note that even though more
than 11 months may have elapsed between being sworn in in January and
December 31, the first year still appears as 0:

...          ...         ...         ...         ...         ...
TIP
If a date dimension is not available, you can create a subquery with the necessary dates in a
couple of ways. If your database supports the generate_series, you can create a
subquery that returns the desired dates:
SELECT generate_series::date as date
FROM generate_series('1770-12-31','2020-12-
31',interval '1 year')
You may want to save this as a table or view for later use. Alternatively, you can query the data
set or any other table in the database that has a full set of dates. In this case, the table has all of
the necessary years, but we will make a December 31 date for each year using the
make_date function:
SELECT distinct
make_date(date_part('year',term_start)::int,12,31)
FROM legislators_terms
There are a number of creative ways to get the series of dates needed. Use whichever method
is available and simplest within your queries.
We now have a row for each date (year end) for which we would like to

## Page 181

calculate retention. The next step is to calculate the cohort_retained for
each period, which is done with a count of id_bioguide. A coalesce
function is used on period to set a default value of 0 when null. This handles
the cases in which a legislator’s term starts and ends in the same year, giving
credit for serving in that year:
SELECT 
coalesce(date_part('year',age(c.date,a.first_term)),0) as period
,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as cohort_retained
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms 
    GROUP BY 1
) a
JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
LEFT JOIN date_dim c on c.date between b.term_start and b.term_end 
and c.month_name = 'December' and c.day_of_month = 31

------  ---------------
0.0     12518
1.0     12328
2.0     8166
...     ...
The final step is to calculate the cohort_size and pct_retained as we
did previously using first_value window functions:
SELECT period
,first_value(cohort_retained) over (order by period) as cohort_size
,cohort_retained
,cohort_retained * 1.0 / 
 first_value(cohort_retained) over (order by period) as pct_retained

(
    SELECT coalesce(date_part('year',age(c.date,a.first_term)),0) as 
period
    ,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as cohort_retained
    FROM
    (
        SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
        FROM legislators_terms

    ) a
    JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
    LEFT JOIN date_dim c on c.date between b.term_start and b.term_end
    and c.month_name = 'December' and c.day_of_month = 31

2.0     12518        8166             0.6523
...     ...          ...              ...
The results, graphed in Figure 4-4, are now much more accurate. Almost all
legislators are still in office in year 1, and the first big drop-off occurs in year 2,
when some representatives will fail to be reelected.

## Page 183

Figure 4-4. Legislator retention after adjusting for actual years in office
If the data set does not contain an end date, there are a couple of options for
imputing one. One option is to add a fixed interval to the start date, when the
length of a subscription or term is known. This can be done with date math by
adding a constant interval to the term_start. Here, a CASE statement
handles the addition for the two term_types:
SELECT a.id_bioguide, a.first_term
,b.term_start

## Page 184

,case when b.term_type = 'rep' then b.term_start + interval '2 years'
      when b.term_type = 'sen' then b.term_start + interval '6 years'
      end as term_end
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms 
    GROUP BY 1
) a
JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
;
id_bioguide  first_term  term_start  term_end
-----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
B000944      1993-01-05  1993-01-05  1995-01-05
C000127      1993-01-05  1993-01-05  1995-01-05
C000141      1987-01-06  1987-01-06  1989-01-06
...          ...         ...         ...
This block of code can then be plugged into the retention code to derive the
period and pct_retained. The drawback to this method is that it fails to
capture instances in which a legislator did not complete a full term, which can
happen in the event of death or appointment to a higher office.
A second option is to use the subsequent starting date, minus one day, as the
term_end date. This can be calculated with the lead window function. This
function is similar to the lag function we’ve used previously, but rather than
returning a value from a row earlier in the partition, it returns a value from a row
later in the partition, as determined in the ORDER BY clause. The default is one
row, which we will use here, but the function has an optional argument
indicating a different number of rows. Here we find the term_start date of
the subsequent term using lead and then subtract the interval '1 day' to
derive the term_end:
SELECT a.id_bioguide, a.first_term
,b.term_start
,lead(b.term_start) over (partition by a.id_bioguide 
                          order by b.term_start) 
 - interval '1 day' as term_end
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms 
    GROUP BY 1

## Page 185

) a
JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
;
id_bioguide  first_term  term_start  term_end
-----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
A000001      1951-01-03  1951-01-03  (null)
A000002      1947-01-03  1947-01-03  1949-01-02
A000002      1947-01-03  1949-01-03  1951-01-02
...          ...         ...         ...
This code block can then be plugged into the retention code. This method has a
couple of drawbacks. First, when there is no subsequent term, the lead function
returns null, leaving that term without a term_end. A default value, such as a
default interval shown in the last example, could be used in such cases. The
second drawback is that this method assumes that terms are always consecutive,
with no time spent out of office. Although most legislators tend to serve
continuously until their congressional careers end, there are certainly examples
of gaps between terms spanning several years.
Any time we make adjustments to fill in missing data, we need to be careful
about the assumptions we make. In subscription- or term-based contexts, explicit
start and end dates tend to be most accurate. Either of the two other methods
shown—adding a fixed interval or setting the end date relative to the next start
date—can be used when no end date is present and we have a reasonable
expectation that most customers or users will stay for the duration assumed.
Now that we’ve seen how to calculate a basic retention curve and correct for
missing dates, we can start adding in cohort groups. Comparing retention
between different groups is one of the main reasons to do cohort analysis. Next,
I’ll discuss forming groups from the time series itself, and after that, I’ll discuss
forming cohort groups from data in other tables.
Cohorts Derived from the Time Series Itself
Now that we have SQL code to calculate retention, we can start to split the
entities into cohorts. In this section, I will show how to derive cohort groupings
from the time series itself. First I’ll discuss time-based cohorts based on the first
date, and I’ll explain how to make cohorts based on other attributes from the
time series.

## Page 186

The most common way to create the cohorts is based on the first or minimum
date or time that the entity appears in the time series. This means that only one
table is necessary for the cohort retention analysis: the time series itself.
Cohorting by the first appearance or action is interesting because often groups
that start at different times behave differently. For consumer services, early
adopters are often more enthusiastic and retain differently than later adopters,
whereas in SaaS software, later adopters may retain better because the product is
more mature. Time-based cohorts can be grouped by any time granularity that is
meaningful to the organization, though weekly, monthly, or yearly cohorts are
common. If you’re not sure what grouping to use, try running the cohort analysis
with different groupings, without making the cohort sizes too small, to see where
meaningful patterns emerge. Fortunately, once you know how to construct the
cohorts and retention analysis, substituting different time granularities is
straightforward.
The first example will use yearly cohorts, and then I will demonstrate swapping
in centuries. The key question we will consider is whether the era in which a
legislator first took office has any correlation with their retention. Political trends
and the public mood do change over time, but by how much?
To calculate yearly cohorts, we first add the year of the first_term
calculated previously to the query that finds the period and
cohort_retained:
SELECT date_part('year',a.first_term) as first_year
,coalesce(date_part('year',age(c.date,a.first_term)),0) as period
,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as cohort_retained
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms 
    GROUP BY 1
) a
JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
LEFT JOIN date_dim c on c.date between b.term_start and b.term_end 
and c.month_name = 'December' and c.day_of_month = 31
GROUP BY 1,2
;
first_year  period  cohort_retained
----------  ------  ---------------
1789.0      0.0     89

## Page 187

1789.0      2.0     89
1789.0      3.0     57
...         ...     ...
This query is then used as the subquery, and the cohort_size and
pct_retained are calculated in the outer query as previously.  In this case,
however, we need a PARTITION BY clause that includes first_year so that
the first_value is calculated only within the set of rows for that
first_year, rather than across the whole result set from the subquery:
SELECT first_year, period
,first_value(cohort_retained) over (partition by first_year 
                                    order by period) as cohort_size
,cohort_retained
,cohort_retained / 
 first_value(cohort_retained) over (partition by first_year 
                                    order by period) as pct_retained
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('year',a.first_term) as first_year
    ,coalesce(date_part('year',age(c.date,a.first_term)),0) as period
    ,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as cohort_retained
    FROM
    (
        SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
        FROM legislators_terms 
        GROUP BY 1
    ) a
    JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
    LEFT JOIN date_dim c on c.date between b.term_start and b.term_end
    and c.month_name = 'December' and c.day_of_month = 31
    GROUP BY 1,2
) aa
;

This data set includes over two hundred starting years, too many to easily graph
or examine in a table. Next we’ll look at a less granular interval and cohort the
legislators by the century of the first_term. This change is easily made by

## Page 188

substituting century for year in the date_part function in subquery aa.
Recall that century names are offset from the years they represent, so that the
18th century lasted from 1700 to 1799, the 19th century lasted from 1800 to
1899, and so on. The partitioning in the first_value function changes to the
first_century field:
SELECT first_century, period
,first_value(cohort_retained) over (partition by first_century 
                                    order by period) as cohort_size
,cohort_retained

The results are graphed in Figure 4-5. Retention in the early years has been
higher for those first elected in the 20th or 21st century. The 21st century is still
underway, and thus many of those legislators have not had the opportunity to
stay in office for five or more years, though they are still included in the
denominator. We might want to consider removing the 21st century from the

analysis, but I’ve left it here to demonstrate how the retention curve drops
artificially due to this circumstance.

Cohorts can be defined from other attributes in a time series besides the first
date, with options depending on the values in the table. The
legislators_terms table has a state field, indicating which state the
person is representing for that term. We can use this to create cohorts, and we
will base them on the first state in order to ensure that anyone who has
represented multiple states appears in the data only once.
WARNING
When cohorting on an attribute that can change over time, it’s important to ensure that each
entity is assigned only one value. Otherwise the entity may be represented in multiple cohorts,
introducing bias into the analysis. Usually the value from the earliest record in the data set is
used.
To find the first state for each legislator, we can use the first_value window
function. In this example, we’ll also turn the min function into a window
function to avoid a lengthy GROUP BY clause:
SELECT distinct id_bioguide
,min(term_start) over (partition by id_bioguide) as first_term
,first_value(state) over (partition by id_bioguide 
                          order by term_start) as first_state
FROM legislators_terms

We can then plug this code into our retention code to find the retention by
first_state:
SELECT first_state, period

                                    order by period) as cohort_size

The retention curves for the five states with the highest total number of
legislators are graphed in Figure 4-6. Those elected in Illinois and Massachusetts
have the highest retention, while New Yorkers have the lowest retention.
Determining the reasons why would be an interesting offshoot of this analysis.

Defining cohorts from the time series is relatively straightforward using a min
date for each entity and then converting that date into a month, year, or century
as appropriate for the analysis. Switching between month and year or other
levels of granularity also is straightforward, allowing for multiple options to be
tested in order to find a grouping that is meaningful for the organization. Other
attributes can be used for cohorting with the first_value window function.
Next, we’ll turn to cases in which the cohorting attribute comes from a table
other than that of the time series.
Defining the Cohort from a Separate Table
Often the characteristics that define a cohort exist in a table separate from the
one that contains the time series. For example, a database might have a customer
table with information such as acquisition source or registration date by which
customers can be cohorted. Adding in attributes from other tables, or even
subqueries, is relatively straightforward and can be done in retention analysis
and related analyses discussed later in the chapter.
For this example, we’ll consider whether the gender of the legislator has any
impact on their retention. The legislators table has a gender field, where
F means female and M means male, that we can use to cohort the legislators. To
do this, we’ll JOIN the legislators table in as alias d to add gender to the
calculation of cohort_retained, in place of year or century:
SELECT d.gender
,coalesce(date_part('year',age(c.date,a.first_term)),0) as period
,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as cohort_retained
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms 
    GROUP BY 1
) a
JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
LEFT JOIN date_dim c on c.date between b.term_start and b.term_end 
and c.month_name = 'December' and c.day_of_month = 31
JOIN legislators d on a.id_bioguide = d.id_bioguide
GROUP BY 1,2
;

It’s immediately clear that many more males than females have served
legislative terms. We can now calculate the percent_retained so we can
compare the retention for these groups:
SELECT gender, period
,first_value(cohort_retained) over (partition by gender 
                                    order by period) as cohort_size

(
    SELECT d.gender
    ,coalesce(date_part('year',age(c.date,a.first_term)),0) as period
    ,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as cohort_retained

        FROM legislators_terms

    JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
    LEFT JOIN date_dim c on c.date between b.term_start and b.term_end
    and c.month_name = 'December' and c.day_of_month = 31

## Page 196

We can see from the results graphed in Figure 4-7 that retention is higher for
female legislators than for their male counterparts for periods 2 through 29. The
first female legislator did not take office until 1917, when Jeannette Rankin
joined the House as a Republican representative from Montana. As we saw
earlier, retention has increased in more recent centuries.

## Page 198

To make a more fair comparison, we might restrict the legislators included in the
analysis to only those whose first_term started since there have been
women in Congress. We can do this by adding a WHERE filter to subquery aa.
Here the results are also restricted to those who started before 2000, to ensure
the cohorts have had at least 20 possible years to stay in office:

Male legislators still outnumber female legislators, but by a smaller margin. The
retention for the cohorts is graphed in Figure 4-8. With the revised cohorts, male

## Page 199

legislators have higher retention through year 7, but starting in year 12, female
legislators have higher retention. The difference between the two gender-based
cohort analyses underscores the importance of setting up appropriate cohorts and
ensuring that they have comparable amounts of time to be present or complete
other actions of interest. To further improve this analysis, we could cohort by
both starting year or decade and gender, in order to control for additional
changes in retention through the 20th century and into the 21st century.

## Page 201

Figure 4-8. Legislator retention by gender: cohorts from 1917 to 1999
Cohorts can be defined in multiple ways, from the time series and from other
tables. With the framework we’ve developed, subqueries, views, or other derived
tables can be swapped in, opening up a whole range of calculations to be the
basis of a cohort. Multiple criteria, such as starting year and gender, can be used.
One caution when dividing populations into cohorts based on multiple criteria is
that this can lead to sparse cohorts, where some of the defined groups are too
small and are not represented in the data set for all time periods. The next section
will discuss methods for overcoming this challenge.
Dealing with Sparse Cohorts
In the ideal data set, every cohort has some action or record in the time series for
every period of interest. We’ve already seen how “missing” dates can occur due
to subscriptions or terms lasting over multiple periods, and we looked at how to
correct for them using a date dimension to infer intermediate dates. Another
issue can arise when, due to grouping criteria, the cohort becomes too small and
as a result is represented only sporadically in the data. A cohort may disappear
from the result set, when we would prefer it to appear with a zero retention
value. This problem is called sparse cohorts, and it can be worked around with
the careful use of LEFT JOINs.
To demonstrate this, let’s attempt to cohort female legislators by the first state
they represented to see if there are any differences in retention. We’ve already
seen that there have been relatively few female legislators. Cohorting them
further by state is highly likely to create some sparse cohorts in which there are
very few members. Before making code adjustments, let’s add first_state
(calculated in the section on deriving cohorts from the time series) into our
previous gender example and look at the results:
SELECT first_state, gender, period
,first_value(cohort_retained) over (partition by first_state, gender 
                                    order by period) as cohort_size
,cohort_retained
,cohort_retained / 
 first_value(cohort_retained) over (partition by first_state, gender 
                                    order by period) as pct_retained
FROM

    FROM
    (
        SELECT distinct id_bioguide
        ,min(term_start) over (partition by id_bioguide) as first_term

    ) a
    JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
    LEFT JOIN date_dim c on c.date between b.term_start and b.term_end
    and c.month_name = 'December' and c.day_of_month = 31
    JOIN legislators d on a.id_bioguide = d.id_bioguide
    WHERE a.first_term between '1917-01-01' and '1999-12-31'
    GROUP BY 1,2,3
) aa

AZ           F       0.0     2            2               1.0000

Graphing the results for the first 20 periods, as in Figure 4-9, reveals the sparse
cohorts. Alaska did not have any female legislators, while Arizona’s female
retention curve disappears after year 3. Only California, a large state with many
legislators, has complete retention curves for both genders. This pattern repeats
for other small and large states.

## Page 204

Figure 4-9. Legislator retention by gender and first state
Now let’s look at how to ensure a record for every period so that the query
returns zero values for retention instead of nulls. The first step is to query for all
combinations of periods and cohort attributes, in this case first_state
and gender, with the starting cohort_size for each combination. This can
be done by JOINing subquery aa, which calculates the cohort, with a
generate_series subquery that returns all integers from 0 to 20, with the
criteria on 1 = 1. This is a handy way to force a Cartesian JOIN when the two
subqueries don’t have any fields in common:
SELECT aa.gender, aa.first_state, cc.period, aa.cohort_size
FROM
(
    SELECT b.gender, a.first_state 
    ,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as cohort_size
    FROM 
    (
        SELECT distinct id_bioguide
        ,min(term_start) over (partition by id_bioguide) as first_term
        ,first_value(state) over (partition by id_bioguide 
                                  order by term_start) as first_state
        FROM legislators_terms 
    ) a
    JOIN legislators b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide
    WHERE a.first_term between '1917-01-01' and '1999-12-31' 
    GROUP BY 1,2
) aa
JOIN
(
    SELECT generate_series as period 
    FROM generate_series(0,20,1)
) cc on 1 = 1
;
gender  state  period  cohort
------  -----  ------  ------
F       AL     0       3
F       AL     1       3
F       AL     2       3
...    ...     ...     ...
The next step is to JOIN this back to the actual periods in office, with a LEFT
JOIN to ensure all the time periods remain in the final result:

We can then pivot the results and confirm that a value exists for each cohort for
each period:

...     ...          ...    ...     ...     ...     ...     ...
Notice that at this point, the SQL code has gotten quite long. One of the harder
parts of writing SQL for cohort retention analysis is keeping all of the logic
straight and the code organized, a topic I’ll discuss more in Chapter 8. When
building up retention code, I find it helpful to go step-by-step, checking results
along the way. I also spot-check individual cohorts to validate that the final
result is accurate.
Cohorts can be defined in many ways. So far, we’ve normalized all our cohorts
to the first date they appear in the time series data. This isn’t the only option,
however, and interesting analysis can be done starting in the middle of an
entity’s life span. Before concluding our work on retention analysis, let’s take a
look at this additional way to define cohorts.
Defining Cohorts from Dates Other Than the First Date
Usually time-based cohorts are defined from the entity’s first appearance in the
time series or from some other earliest date, such as a registration date. However,
cohorting on a different date can be useful and insightful. For example, we might
want to look at retention across all customers using a service as of a particular
date. This type of analysis can be used to understand whether product or
marketing changes have had a long-term impact on existing customers.

## Page 207

When using a date other than the first date, we need to take care to precisely
define the criteria for inclusion in each cohort. One option is to pick entities
present on a particular calendar date. This is relatively straightforward to put into
SQL code, but it can be problematic if a large share of the regular user
population doesn’t show up every day, causing retention to vary depending on
the exact day chosen. One option to correct for this is to calculate retention for
several starting dates and then average the results.
Another option is to use a window of time such as a week or month. Any entity
that appears in the data set during that window is included in the cohort. While
this approach is often more representative of the business or process, the trade-
off is that the SQL code will become more complex, and the query time may be
slower due to more intense database calculations. Finding the right balance
between query performance and accuracy of results is something of an art.
Let’s take a look at how to calculate such midstream analysis with the legislators
data set by considering retention for legislators who were in office in the year
2000. We’ll cohort by the term_type, which has values of “sen” for senators
and “rep” for representatives. The definition will include any legislator in office
at any time during the year 2000: those who started prior to 2000 and whose
terms ended during or after 2000 qualify, as do those who started a term in 2000.
We can hardcode any date in 2000 as the first_term, since we will later
check whether they were in office at some point during 2000. The min_start
of the terms falling in this window is also calculated for use in a later step:
SELECT distinct id_bioguide, term_type, date('2000-01-01') as 
first_term
,min(term_start) as min_start
FROM legislators_terms 
WHERE term_start <= '2000-12-31' and term_end >= '2000-01-01'
GROUP BY 1,2,3
;
id_bioguide  term_type  first_term  min_start
-----------  ---------  ----------  ---------
C000858      sen        2000-01-01  1997-01-07
G000333      sen        2000-01-01  1995-01-04
M000350      rep        2000-01-01  1999-01-06
...          ...        ...         ...
We can then plug this into our retention code, with two adjustments. First, an

## Page 208

additional JOIN criteria between subquery a and the legislators_terms
table is added in order to return only terms that started on or after the
min_start date. Second, an additional filter is added to the date_dim so
that it only returns dates in 2000 or later:
SELECT term_type, period
,first_value(cohort_retained) over (partition by term_type order by 
period) 
 as cohort_size
,cohort_retained
,cohort_retained / 
 first_value(cohort_retained) over (partition by term_type order by 
period) 
 as pct_retained

    SELECT a.term_type

        SELECT distinct id_bioguide, term_type
        ,date('2000-01-01') as first_term

        FROM legislators_terms 
        WHERE term_start <= '2000-12-31' and term_end >= '2000-01-01'
        GROUP BY 1,2,3
    ) a
    JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
    and b.term_start >= a.min_start
    LEFT JOIN date_dim c on c.date between b.term_start and b.term_end
    and c.month_name = 'December' and c.day_of_month = 31 
    and c.year >= 2000
    GROUP BY 1,2
) aa

Figure 4-10 shows that despite longer terms for senators, retention among the

## Page 209

two cohorts was similar, and was actually worse for senators after 10 years. A
further analysis comparing the different years they were first elected, or other
cohort attributes, might yield some interesting insights.

## Page 211

Figure 4-10. Retention by term type for legislators in office during the year 2000
A common use case for cohorting on a value other than a starting value is when
trying to analyze retention after an entity has reached a threshold, such as a
certain number of purchases or a certain amount spent. As with any cohort, it’s
important to take care in defining what qualifies an entity to be in a cohort and
which date will be used as the starting date.
Cohort retention is a powerful way to understand the behavior of entities in a
time series data set. We’ve seen how to calculate retention with SQL and how to
cohort based on the time series itself or on other tables, and from points in the
middle of entity life span. We also looked at how to use functions and JOINs to
adjust dates within time series and compensate for sparse cohorts. There are
several types of analyses that are related to cohort retention: analysis,
survivorship, returnship, and cumulative calculations, all of which build off of
the SQL code that we’ve developed for retention. Let’s turn to them next.
Related Cohort Analyses
In the last section, we learned how to write SQL for cohort retention analysis.
Retention captures whether an entity was in a time series data set on a specific
date or window of time. In addition to presence on a specific date, analysis is
often interested in questions of how long an entity lasted, whether an entity did
multiple actions, and how many of those actions occurred. These can all be
answered with code that is similar to retention and is well suited to just about
any cohorting criteria you like. Let’s take a look at the first of these,
survivorship.
Survivorship
Survivorship, also called survival analysis, is concerned with questions about
how long something lasts, or the duration of time until a particular event such as
churn or death. Survivorship analysis can answer questions about the share of
the population that is likely to remain past a certain amount of time. Cohorts can
help identify or at least provide hypotheses about which characteristics or
circumstances increase or decrease the survival likelihood.

## Page 212

This is similar to a retention analysis, but instead of calculating whether an entity
was present in a certain period, we calculate whether the entity is present in that
period or later in the time series. Then the share of the total cohort is calculated.
Typically one or more periods are chosen depending on the nature of the data set
analyzed. For example, if we want to know the share of game players who
survive for a week or longer, we can check for actions that occur after a week
from starting and consider those players still surviving. On the other hand, if we
are concerned about the number of students who are still in school after a certain
number of years, we could look for the absence of a graduation event in a data
set. The number of periods can be SELECTed either by calculating an average or
typical life span or by choosing time periods that are meaningful to the
organization or process analyzed, such as a month, year, or longer time period.
In this example, we’ll look at the share of legislators who survived in office for a
decade or more after their first term started. Since we don’t need to know the
specific dates of each term, we can start by calculating the first and last
term_start dates, using min and max aggregations:
SELECT id_bioguide
,min(term_start) as first_term
,max(term_start) as last_term
FROM legislators_terms
GROUP BY 1
;
id_bioguide  first_term  last_term
-----------  ----------  ---------
A000118      1975-01-14  1977-01-04
P000281      1933-03-09  1937-01-05
K000039      1933-03-09  1951-01-03
...          ...         ...
Next, we add to the query a date_part function to find the century of the min
term_start, and we calculate the tenure as the number of years between
the min and max term_starts found with the age function:
SELECT id_bioguide
,date_part('century',min(term_start)) as first_century
,min(term_start) as first_term
,max(term_start) as last_term
,date_part('year',age(max(term_start),min(term_start))) as tenure

## Page 213

GROUP BY 1

...          ...            ...         ...         ...
Finally, we calculate the cohort_size with a count of all the legislators, as
well as calculating the number who survived for at least 10 years by using a
CASE statement and count aggregation. The percent who survived is found by
dividing these two values:
SELECT first_century
,count(distinct id_bioguide) as cohort_size
,count(distinct case when tenure >= 10 then id_bioguide 
                     end) as survived_10
,count(distinct case when tenure >= 10 then id_bioguide end) 
 / count(distinct id_bioguide) as pct_survived_10
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide
    ,date_part('century',min(term_start)) as first_century
    ,min(term_start) as first_term
    ,max(term_start) as last_term
    ,date_part('year',age(max(term_start),min(term_start))) as tenure
    FROM legislators_terms
    GROUP BY 1
) a
GROUP BY 1
;
century  cohort  survived_10  pct_survived_10
-------  ------  -----------  ---------------
18       368     83           0.2255
19       6299    892          0.1416
20       5091    1853         0.3640
21       760     119          0.1566
Since terms may or may not be consecutive, we can also calculate the share of
legislators in each century who survived for five or more total terms. In the
subquery, add a count to find the total number of terms per legislator. Then in

## Page 214

the outer query, divide the number of legislators with five or more terms by the
total cohort size:
SELECT first_century
,count(distinct id_bioguide) as cohort_size
,count(distinct case when total_terms >= 5 then id_bioguide end) 
 as survived_5
,count(distinct case when total_terms >= 5 then id_bioguide end)
 / count(distinct id_bioguide) as pct_survived_5_terms
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide
    ,date_part('century',min(term_start)) as first_century
    ,count(term_start) as total_terms
    FROM legislators_terms
    GROUP BY 1
) a
GROUP BY 1
;
century  cohort  survived_5  pct_survived_5_terms
-------  ------  ----------  --------------------
18       368     63          0.1712
19       6299    711         0.1129
20       5091    2153        0.4229
21       760     205         0.2697
Ten years or five terms is somewhat arbitrary. We can also calculate the
survivorship for each number of years or periods and display the results in graph
or table form. Here, we calculate the survivorship for each number of terms from
1 to 20. This is accomplished through a Cartesian JOIN to a subquery that
contains those integers derived by the generate_series function:
SELECT a.first_century, b.terms
,count(distinct id_bioguide) as cohort
,count(distinct case when a.total_terms >= b.terms then id_bioguide 
                     end) as cohort_survived
,count(distinct case when a.total_terms >= b.terms then id_bioguide 
                     end)
 / count(distinct id_bioguide) as pct_survived
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide
    ,date_part('century',min(term_start)) as first_century
    ,count(term_start) as total_terms
    FROM legislators_terms

## Page 215

GROUP BY 1

(
    SELECT generate_series as terms

) b on 1 = 1

...      ...    ...     ...              ...
The results are graphed in Figure 4-11. Survivorship was highest in the 20th
century, a result that agrees with results we saw previously in which retention
was also highest in the 20th century.

## Page 217

Figure 4-11. Survivorship for legislators: share of cohort who stayed in office for that many terms or longer
Survivorship is closely related to retention. While retention counts entities
present in a specific number of periods from the start, survivorship considers
only whether an entity was present as of a specific period or later. As a result, the
code is simpler since it needs only the first and last dates in the time series, or a
count of dates. Cohorting is done similar to cohorting for retention, and cohort
definitions can come from within the time series or be derived from another
table or subquery.
Next we’ll consider another type of analysis that is in some ways the inverse of
survivorship. Rather than calculating whether an entity is present in the data set
at a certain time or later, we will calculate whether an entity returns or repeats an
action at a certain period or earlier. This is called returnship or repeat purchase
behavior.
Returnship, or Repeat Purchase Behavior
Survivorship is useful for understanding how long a cohort is likely to stick
around. Another useful type of cohort analysis seeks to understand whether a
cohort member can be expected to return within a given window of time and the
intensity of activity during that window. This is called returnship or repeat
purchase behavior.
For example, an ecommerce site might want to know not only how many new
buyers were acquired via a marketing campaign but also whether those buyers
have become repeat buyers. One way to figure this out is to simply calculate
total purchases per customer. However, comparing customers acquired two years
ago with those acquired a month ago isn’t fair, since the former have had a much
longer time in which to return. The older cohort would almost certainly appear
more valuable than the newer one. Although this is true in a sense, it gives an
incomplete picture of how the cohorts are likely to behave across their entire life
span.
To make fair comparisons between cohorts with different starting dates, we need
to create an analysis based on a time box, or a fixed window of time from the
first date, and consider whether cohort members returned within that window.
This way, every cohort has an equal amount of time under consideration, so long

## Page 218

as we include only those cohorts for which the full window has elapsed.
Returnship analysis is common for retail organizations, but it can also be applied
in other domains. For example, a university might want to see how many
students enrolled in a second course, or a hospital might be interested in how
many patients need follow-up medical treatments after an initial incident.
To demonstrate returnship analysis, we can ask a new question of the legislators
data set: how many legislators have more than one term type, and specifically,
what share of them start as representatives and go on to become senators (some
senators later become representatives, but that is much less common). Since
relatively few make this transition, we’ll cohort legislators by the century in
which they first became a representative.
The first step is to find the cohort size for each century, using the subquery and
date_part calculations seen previously, for only those with term_type =
'rep':
SELECT date_part('century',a.first_term) as cohort_century
,count(id_bioguide) as reps
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms
    WHERE term_type = 'rep'
    GROUP BY 1
) a
GROUP BY 1
;
cohort_century  reps

18              299
19              5773
20              4481
21              683
Next we’ll perform a similar calculation, with a JOIN to the
legislators_terms table, to find the representatives who later became
senators. This is accomplished with the clauses b.term_type = 'sen' and
b.term_start > a.first_term:
SELECT date_part('century',a.first_term) as cohort_century

## Page 219

,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as rep_and_sen
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms
    WHERE term_type = 'rep'
    GROUP BY 1
) a
JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide
and b.term_type = 'sen' and b.term_start > a.first_term
GROUP BY 1
;
cohort_century  rep_and_sen
--------------  -----------
18              57
19              329
20              254
21              25
Finally, we JOIN these two subqueries together and calculate the percent of
representatives who became senators. A LEFT JOIN is used; this clause is
typically recommended to ensure that all cohorts are included whether or not the
subsequent event happened. If there is a century in which no representatives
became senators, we still want to include that century in the result set:
SELECT aa.cohort_century
,bb.rep_and_sen / aa.reps as pct_rep_and_sen
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('century',a.first_term) as cohort_century
    ,count(id_bioguide) as reps
    FROM
    (
        SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
        FROM legislators_terms
        WHERE term_type = 'rep'
        GROUP BY 1
    ) a
    GROUP BY 1
) aa
LEFT JOIN
(
    SELECT date_part('century',b.first_term) as cohort_century
    ,count(distinct b.id_bioguide) as rep_and_sen
    FROM
    (

## Page 220

        FROM legislators_terms
        WHERE term_type = 'rep'
        GROUP BY 1
    ) b
    JOIN legislators_terms c on b.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide
    and c.term_type = 'sen' and c.term_start > b.first_term
    GROUP BY 1
) bb on aa.cohort_century = bb.cohort_century

cohort_century  pct_rep_and_sen
--------------  ---------------
18              0.1906
19              0.0570
20              0.0567
21              0.0366
Representatives from the 18th century were most likely to become senators.
However, we have not yet applied a time box to ensure a fair comparison. While
we can safely assume that all legislators who served in the 18th and 19th
centuries are no longer living, many of those who were first elected in the 20th
and 21st centuries are still in the middle of their careers. Adding the filter
WHERE age(c.term_start, b.first_term) <= interval '10
years' to subquery bb creates a time box of 10 years. Note that the window
can easily be made larger or smaller by changing the constant in the interval. An
additional filter applied to subquery a, WHERE first_term <= '2009-
12-31', excludes those who were less than 10 years into their careers when the
data set was assembled:
SELECT aa.cohort_century
,bb.rep_and_sen * 100.0 / aa.reps as pct_10_yrs
FROM
(
    SELECT date_part('century',a.first_term)::int as cohort_century
    ,count(id_bioguide) as reps
    FROM
    (
        SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
        FROM legislators_terms
        WHERE term_type = 'rep'
        GROUP BY 1
    ) a
    WHERE first_term <= '2009-12-31'

    SELECT date_part('century',b.first_term)::int as cohort_century

        SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
        FROM legislators_terms
        WHERE term_type = 'rep'
        GROUP BY 1
    ) b
    JOIN legislators_terms c on b.id_bioguide = c.id_bioguide
    and c.term_type = 'sen' and c.term_start > b.first_term
    WHERE age(c.term_start, b.first_term) <= interval '10 years'
    GROUP BY 1
) bb on aa.cohort_century = bb.cohort_century

Cohort_century  pct_10_yrs

20              0.0348
21              0.0764
With this new adjustment, the 18th century still had the highest share of
representatives becoming senators within 10 years, but the 21st century has the
second-highest share, and the 20th century had a higher share than the 19th.
Since 10 years is somewhat arbitrary, we might also want to compare several
time windows. One option is to run the query several times with different
intervals and note the results. Another option is to calculate multiple windows in
the same result set by using a set of CASE statements inside of count
distinct aggregations to form the intervals, rather than specifying the
interval in the WHERE clause:
SELECT aa.cohort_century
,bb.rep_and_sen_5_yrs * 1.0 / aa.reps as pct_5_yrs
,bb.rep_and_sen_10_yrs * 1.0 / aa.reps as pct_10_yrs

With this output, we can see how the share of representatives who became
senators evolved over time, both within each cohort and across cohorts. In
addition to the table format, graphing the output often reveals interesting trends.
In Figure 4-12, the cohorts based on century are replaced with cohorts based on
the first decade, and the trends over 10 and 20 years are shown. Conversion of

## Page 223

representatives to senators during the first few decades of the new US legislature
was clearly different from patterns in the years since.

Finding the repeat behavior within a fixed time box is a useful tool for
comparing cohorts. This is particularly true when the behaviors are intermittent
in nature, such as purchase behavior or content or service consumption. In the
next section, we’ll look at how to calculate not only whether an entity had a
subsequent action but also how many subsequent actions they had, and we’ll
aggregate them with cumulative calculations.
Cumulative Calculations
Cumulative cohort analysis can be used to establish cumulative lifetime value,
also called customer lifetime value (the acronyms CLTV and LTV are used
interchangeably), and to monitor newer cohorts in order to be able to predict
what their full LTV will be. This is possible because early behavior is often
highly correlated with long-term behavior. Users of a service who return
frequently in their first days or weeks of using it tend to be the most likely to
stay around over the long term. Customers who buy a second or third time early
on are likely to continue purchasing over a longer time period. Subscribers who
renew after the first month or year are often likely to stick around over many
subsequent months or years.
In this section, I’ll mainly talk about the revenue-generating activities of
customers, but this analysis can also be applied to situations in which customers
or entities incur costs, such as through product returns, support interactions, or
use of health-care services.
With cumulative calculations, we’re less concerned about whether an entity did
an action on a particular date and more about the total as of a particular date. The
cumulative calculations used in this type of analysis are most often counts or
sums. We will again use the time box concept to ensure apples-to-apples
comparisons between cohorts. Let’s look at the number of terms started within
10 years of the first term_start, cohorting the legislators by century and type
of first term:
SELECT date_part('century',a.first_term) as century

21       sen         77      118
The largest cohort is that of representatives first elected in the 19th century, but
the cohort with the largest number of terms started within 10 years is that of
representatives first elected in the 20th century. This type of calculation can be
useful for understanding the overall contribution of a cohort to an organization.
Total sales or total repeat purchases can be valuable metrics. Usually, though, we
want to normalize to understand the contribution on a per-entity basis.
Calculations we might want to make include average actions per person, average
order value (AOV), items per order, and orders per customer. To normalize by
the cohort size, simply divide by the starting cohort, which we’ve done
previously with retention, survivorship, and returnship. Here we do that and also
pivot the results into table form for easier comparisons:
SELECT century
,max(case when first_type = 'rep' then cohort end) as rep_cohort
,max(case when first_type = 'rep' then terms_per_leg end) 
 as avg_rep_terms

With the cumulative terms normalized by the cohort size, we can now confirm
that representatives first elected in the 20th century had the highest average
number of terms, while those who started in the 19th century had the fewest
number of terms on average. Senators have fewer but longer terms than their
representative peers, and again those who started in the 20th century have had
the highest number of terms on average.
Cumulative calculations are often used in customer lifetime value calculations.
LTV is usually calculated using monetary measures, such as total dollars spent
by a customer, or the gross margin (revenue minus costs) generated by a
customer across their lifetime. To facilitate comparisons between cohorts, the

## Page 228

“lifetime” is often chosen to reflect average customer lifetime, or periods that are
convenient to analyze, such as 3, 5, or 10 years. The legislators data set doesn’t
contain financial metrics, but swapping in dollar values in any of the preceding
SQL code would be straightforward. Fortunately, SQL is a flexible enough
language that we can adapt these templates to address a wide variety of
analytical questions.
Cohort analysis includes a set of techniques that can be used to answer questions
related to behavior over time and how various attributes may contribute to
differences between groups. Survivorship, returnship, and cumulative
calculations all shed light on these questions. With a good understanding of how
cohorts behave, we often have to turn our attention back to the composition or
mix of cohorts over time, understanding how that can impact total retention,
survivorship, returnship, or cumulative values such that these measures differ
surprisingly from the individual cohorts.

## Page 229

Cross-Section Analysis, Through a Cohort Lens
So far in this chapter, we’ve been looking at cohort analysis. We’ve followed the
behavior of cohorts across time with retention, survivorship, returnship, and
cumulative behavior analyses. One of the challenges with these analyses,
however, is that even as they make changes within cohorts easy to spot, it can be
difficult to spot changes in the overall composition of a customer or user base.
Mix shifts, which are changes in the composition of the customer or user base
over time, can also occur, making later cohorts different from earlier ones. Mix
shifts may be due to international expansion, shifting between organic and paid
acquisition strategies, or moving from a niche enthusiast audience to a broader
mass market one. Creating additional cohorts, or segments, along any of these
suspected lines can help diagnose whether a mix shift is happening.
Cohort analysis can be contrasted with cross-sectional analysis, which compares
individuals or groups at a single point in time. Cross-sectional studies can
correlate years of education with current income, for example. On the positive
side, collecting data sets for cross-sectional analysis is often easier since no time
series is necessary. Cross-sectional analysis can be insightful, generating
hypotheses for further investigation. On the negative side, a form of selection
bias called survivorship bias usually exists, which can lead to false conclusions.
SURVIVORSHIP BIAS
“Let’s look at our best customers and see what they have in common.” This
seemingly innocent and well-intentioned idea can lead to some very
problematic conclusions. Survivorship bias is the logical error of focusing on
the people or things that made it past some selection process, while ignoring
those that did not. Commonly this is because the entities no longer exist in
the data set at the time of selection, because they have failed, churned, or left
the population for some other reason. Concentrating only on the remaining
population can lead to overly optimistic conclusions, because failures are
ignored.
Much has been written about a few people who dropped out of college and

## Page 230

started wildly successful technology companies. This doesn’t mean you
should immediately leave college, since the vast majority of people who
drop out do not go on to be successful CEOs. That part of the population
doesn’t make for nearly as sensational headlines, so it’s easy to forget about
that reality.
In the successful customer context, survivorship bias might show up as an
observation that the best customers tend to live in California or Texas and
tend to be 18 to 30 years old. This is a large population to start with, and it
may turn out that these characteristics are shared by many customers who
churned prior to the analysis date. Going back to the original population
might reveal that other demographics, such as 41-to-50-year-olds in
Vermont, actually stick around and spend more over time, even though there
are fewer of them in absolute terms. Cohort analysis helps distinguish and
reduce survivorship bias.
Cohort analysis is a way to overcome survivorship bias by including all
members of a starting cohort in the analysis. We can take a series of cross
sections from a cohort analysis to understand how the mix of entities may have
changed over time. On any given date, users from a variety of cohorts are
present. We can use cross-sectional analysis to examine them, like layers of
sediment, to reveal new insights. In the next example, we’ll create a time series
of the share of legislators from each cohort for each year in the data set.
The first step is to find the number of legislators in office each year by JOINing
the legislators table to the date_dim, WHERE the date from the
date_dim is between the start and end dates of each term. Here we use
December 31 for each year to find the legislators in office at each year’s end:
SELECT b.date, count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as legislators
FROM legislators_terms a
JOIN date_dim b on b.date between a.term_start and a.term_end
and b.month_name = 'December' and b.day_of_month = 31
and b.year <= 2019
GROUP BY 1
;
date        legislators
----------  -----------
1789-12-31  89

## Page 231

1790-12-31  95
1791-12-31  99
...         ...
Next, we add in the century cohorting criteria by JOINing to a subquery with the
first_term calculated:
SELECT b.date
,date_part('century',first_term) as century
,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as legislators
FROM legislators_terms a
JOIN date_dim b on b.date between a.term_start and a.term_end
 and b.month_name = 'December' and b.day_of_month = 31
 and b.year <= 2019
JOIN
(
    SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms
    GROUP BY 1
) c on a.id_bioguide = c.id_bioguide        
GROUP BY 1,2
;
date        century  legislators
----------  -------  -----------
1789-12-31  18       89
1790-12-31  18       95
1791-12-31  18       99
...         ...      ...
Finally, we calculate the percent of total legislators in each year that the
century cohort represents. This can be done in a couple of ways, depending on
the shape of output desired. The first way is to keep a row for each date and
century combination and use a sum window function in the denominator of
the percentage calculation:
SELECT date
,century
,legislators
,sum(legislators) over (partition by date) as cohort
,legislators / sum(legislators) over (partition by date) 
 as pct_century
FROM
(
    SELECT b.date

## Page 232

,date_part('century',first_term) as century
    ,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as legislators
    FROM legislators_terms a
    JOIN date_dim b on b.date between a.term_start and a.term_end
    and b.month_name = 'December' and b.day_of_month = 31
    and b.year <= 2019
    JOIN
    (
        SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term
        FROM legislators_terms
        GROUP BY 1
    ) c on a.id_bioguide = c.id_bioguide        
    GROUP BY 1,2
) a
;
date        century  legislators  cohort  pct_century
----------  -------  -----------  ------  -----------
2018-12-31  20       122          539     0.2263
2018-12-31  21       417          539     0.7737
2019-12-31  20       97           537     0.1806
2019-12-31  21       440          537     0.8194
...         ...      ...          ...     ...
The second approach results in one row per year, with a column for each century,
a table format that may be easier to scan for trends:
SELECT date
,coalesce(sum(case when century = 18 then legislators end)
          / sum(legislators),0) as pct_18
,coalesce(sum(case when century = 19 then legislators end)
          / sum(legislators),0) as pct_19
,coalesce(sum(case when century = 20 then legislators end)
          / sum(legislators),0) as pct_20
,coalesce(sum(case when century = 21 then legislators end)
          / sum(legislators),0) as pct_21
FROM
(
    SELECT b.date
    ,date_part('century',first_term) as century
    ,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as legislators
    FROM legislators_terms a
    JOIN date_dim b on b.date between a.term_start and a.term_end
     and b.month_name = 'December' and b.day_of_month = 31
     and b.year <= 2019
    JOIN
    (
        SELECT id_bioguide, min(term_start) as first_term

## Page 233

FROM legislators_terms
        GROUP BY 1
    ) c on a.id_bioguide = c.id_bioguide        
    GROUP BY 1,2
) aa
GROUP BY 1
;
date        pct_18  pct_19  pct_20  pct_21
----------  ------  ------  ------  ------
2017-12-31  0       0       0.2305  0.7695
2018-12-31  0       0       0.2263  0.7737
2019-12-31  0       0       0.1806  0.8193
...         ...     ...     ...     ...
We can graph the output, as in Figure 4-13, to see how newer cohorts of
legislators gradually overtake older cohorts, until they themselves are replaced
by new cohorts.

## Page 235

Figure 4-13. Percent of legislators each year, by century first elected
Rather than cohorting on first_term, we can cohort on tenure instead.
Finding the share of customers who are relatively new, are of medium tenure, or
are long-term customers at various points in time can be insightful. Let’s take a
look at how the tenure of legislators in Congress has changed over time. 
The first step is to calculate, for each year, the cumulative number of years in
office for each legislator. Since there can be gaps between terms when legislators
are voted out or leave office for other reasons, we’ll first find each year in which
the legislator was in office at the end of the year, in the subquery. Then we’ll use
a count window function, with the window covering the rows unbounded
preceding, or all prior rows for that legislator, and current row:
SELECT id_bioguide, date
,count(date) over (partition by id_bioguide 
                   order by date rows between 
                   unbounded preceding and current row
                   ) as cume_years
FROM
(
    SELECT distinct a.id_bioguide, b.date
    FROM legislators_terms a
    JOIN date_dim b on b.date between a.term_start and a.term_end
     and b.month_name = 'December' and b.day_of_month = 31
     and b.year <= 2019
) aa
;
id_bioguide  date        cume_years
-----------  ----------  ----------
A000001      1951-12-31  1
A000001      1952-12-31  2
A000002      1947-12-31  1
A000002      1948-12-31  2
A000002      1949-12-31  3
...          ...         ...
Next, count the number of legislators for each combination of date and
cume_years to create a distribution:
SELECT date, cume_years

## Page 236

,count(distinct id_bioguide) as legislators
FROM
(
SELECT id_bioguide, date
,count(date) over (partition by id_bioguide 
                   order by date rows between 
                   unbounded preceding and current row
                   ) as cume_years
FROM
(
    SELECT distinct a.id_bioguide, b.date
    FROM legislators_terms a
    JOIN date_dim b on b.date between a.term_start and a.term_end
     and b.month_name = 'December' and b.day_of_month = 31
     and b.year <= 2019

    ) aa

1790-12-31   2           89
1791-12-31   1           37
...          ...         ...
Before calculating the percentage for each tenure per year and adjusting the
presentation format, we might want to consider grouping the tenures. A quick
profiling of our results so far reveals that in some years, almost 40 different
tenures are represented. This will likely be difficult to visualize and interpret:
SELECT date, count(*) as tenures
FROM 
(
    SELECT date, cume_years
    ,count(distinct id_bioguide) as legislators
    FROM
    (
        SELECT id_bioguide, date
        ,count(date) over (partition by id_bioguide 
                           order by date rows between 
                           unbounded preceding and current row
                           ) as cume_years
        FROM

## Page 237

(
            SELECT distinct a.id_bioguide, b.date
            FROM legislators_terms a
            JOIN date_dim b 
             on b.date between a.term_start and a.term_end
             and b.month_name = 'December' and b.day_of_month = 31
             and b.year <= 2019
            GROUP BY 1,2
        ) aa
    ) aaa
    GROUP BY 1,2
) aaaa
GROUP BY 1

1994-12-31   39
1996-12-31   38
...          ...
As a result, we may want to group the values. There is no single right way to
group tenures. If there are organizational definitions of tenure groups, go ahead
and use them. Otherwise, I usually try to break them up into three to five groups
of roughly equal size. Here we’ll group the tenures into four cohorts, where
cume_years is less than or equal to 4 years, between 5 and 10 years, between
11 and 20 years, and equal to or more than 21 years:
SELECT date, tenure
,legislators / sum(legislators) over (partition by date) 
 as pct_legislators 
FROM
(
    SELECT date
    ,case when cume_years <= 4 then '1 to 4'
          when cume_years <= 10 then '5 to 10'
          when cume_years <= 20 then '11 to 20'
          else '21+' end as tenure
    ,count(distinct id_bioguide) as legislators
    FROM
    (
        SELECT id_bioguide, date
        ,count(date) over (partition by id_bioguide

The graphing of the results in Figure 4-14 shows that in the early years of the
country, most legislators had very little tenure. In more recent years, the share of
legislators with 21 or more years in office has been increasing. There are also
interesting periodic increases in 1-to-4-year-tenure legislators that may reflect
shifts in political trends.

A cross section of a population at any point in time is made up of members from
multiple cohorts. Creating a time series of these cross sections is another
interesting way of analyzing trends. Combining this with insights from retention
can provide a more robust picture of trends in any organization.
Conclusion
Cohort analysis is a useful way to investigate how groups change over time,
whether it be from the perspective of retention, repeat behavior, or cumulative
actions. Cohort analysis is retrospective, looking back at populations using
intrinsic attributes or attributes derived from behavior. Interesting and hopefully
useful correlations can be found through this type of analysis. However, as the
saying goes, correlation does not imply causation. To determine actual causality,
randomized experiments are the gold standard. Chapter 7 will go into depth on
experiment analysis.
Before we turn to experimentation, however, we have a few other types of
analysis to cover. Next we’ll cover text analysis: components of text analysis
often show up in other analyses, and it’s an interesting facet of analysis in itself.

## Page 241

Chapter 5. Text Analysis
In the last two chapters, we explored applications of dates and numbers with
time series analysis and cohort analysis. But data sets are often more than just
numeric values and associated timestamps. From qualitative attributes to free
text, character fields are often loaded with potentially interesting information.
Although databases excel at numeric calculations such as counting, summing,
and averaging things, they are also quite good at performing operations on text
data.
I’ll begin this chapter by providing an overview of the types of text analysis
tasks that SQL is good for, and of those for which another programming
language is a better choice. Next, I’ll introduce our data set of UFO sightings.
Then we’ll get into coding, covering text characteristics and profiling, parsing
data with SQL, making various transformations, constructing new text from
parts, and finally finding elements within larger blocks of text, including with
regular expressions.
Why Text Analysis with SQL?
Among the huge volumes of data generated every day, a large portion consists of
text: words, sentences, paragraphs, and even longer documents. Text data used
for analysis can come from a variety of sources, including descriptors populated
by humans or computer applications, log files, support tickets, customer surveys,
social media posts, or news feeds. Text in databases ranges from structured
(where data is in different table fields with distinct meanings) to semistructured
(where the data is in separate columns but may need parsing or cleaning to be
useful) or mostly unstructured (where long VARCHAR or BLOB fields hold
arbitrary length strings that require extensive structuring before further analysis).
Fortunately, SQL has a number of useful functions that can be combined to
accomplish a range of text-structuring and analysis tasks.
What Is Text Analysis?

## Page 242

Text analysis is the process of deriving meaning and insight from text data.
There are two broad categories of text analysis, which can be distinguished by
whether the output is qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative analysis, which may
also be called textual analysis, seeks to understand and synthesize the meaning
from a single text or a set of texts, often applying other knowledge or unique
conclusions. This work is often done by journalists, historians, and user
experience researchers. Quantitative analysis of text also seeks to synthesize
information from text data, but the output is quantitative. Tasks include
categorization and data extraction, and analysis is usually in the form of counts
or frequencies, often trended over time. SQL is much more suited to quantitative
analysis, so that is what the rest of this chapter is concerned with. If you have the
opportunity to work with a counterpart who specializes in the first type of text
analysis, however, do take advantage of their expertise. Combining the
qualitative with the quantitative is a great way to derive new insights and
persuade reluctant colleagues.
Text analysis encompasses several goals or strategies. The first is text extraction,
where a useful piece of data must be pulled from surrounding text. Another is
categorization, where information is extracted or parsed from text data in order
to assign tags or categories to rows in a database. Another strategy is sentiment
analysis, where the goal is to understand the mood or intent of the writer on a
scale from negative to positive.
Although text analysis has been around for a while, interest and research in this
area have taken off with the advent of machine learning and the computing
resources that are often needed to work with large volumes of text data. Natural
language processing (NLP) has made huge advances in recognizing, classifying,
and even generating brand-new text data. Human language is incredibly
complex, with different languages and dialects, grammars, and slang, not to
mention the thousands and thousands of words, some that have overlapping
meanings or subtly modify the meaning of other words. As we’ll see, SQL is
good at some forms of text analysis, but for other, more advanced tasks, there are
languages and tools that are better suited.
Why SQL Is a Good Choice for Text Analysis
There are a number of good reasons to use SQL for text analysis. One of the

## Page 243

most obvious is when the data is already in a database. Modern databases have a
lot of computing power that can be leveraged for text tasks in addition to the
other tasks we’ve discussed so far. Moving data to a flat file for analysis with
another language or tool is time consuming, so doing as much work as possible
with SQL within the database has advantages.
If the data is not already in a database, for relatively large data sets, moving the
data to a database may be worthwhile. Databases are more powerful than
spreadsheets for processing transformations on many records. SQL is less error-
prone than spreadsheets, since no copying and pasting is required, and the
original data stays intact. Data could potentially be altered with an UPDATE
command, but this is hard to do accidentally.
SQL is also a good choice when the end goal is quantification of some sort.
Counting how many support tickets contain a key phrase and parsing categories
out of larger text that will be used to group records are good examples of when
SQL shines. SQL is good at cleaning and structuring text fields. Cleaning
includes removing extra characters or whitespace, fixing capitalization, and
standardizing spellings. Structuring involves creating new columns from
elements extracted or derived from other fields or constructing new fields from
parts stored in different places. String functions can be nested or applied to the
results of other functions, allowing for almost any manipulations that might be
needed.
SQL code for text analysis can be simple or complex, but it is always rule based.
In a rule-based system, the computer follows a set of rules or instructions—no
more, no less. This can be contrasted with machine learning, in which the
computer adapts based on the data. Rules are good because they are easy for
humans to understand. They are written down in code form and can be checked
to ensure they produce the desired output. The downside of rules is that they can
become long and complicated, particularly when there are a lot of different cases
to handle. This can also make them difficult to maintain. If the structure or type
of data entered into the column changes, the rule set needs to be updated. On
more than one occasion, I’ve started with what seemed like a simple CASE
statement with 4 or 5 lines, only to have it grow to 50 or 100 lines as the
application changed. Rules might still be the right approach, but keeping in sync
with the development team on changes is a good idea.

## Page 244

Finally, SQL is a good choice when you know in advance what you are looking
for. There are a number of powerful functions, including regular expressions,
that allow you to search for, extract, or replace specific pieces of information.
“How many reviewers mention ‘short battery life’ in their reviews?” is a
question SQL can help you answer. On the other hand, “Why are these
customers angry?” is not going to be as easy.
When SQL Is Not a Good Choice
SQL essentially allows you to harness the power of the database to apply a set of
rules, albeit often powerful rules, to a set of text to make it more useful for
analysis. SQL is certainly not the only option for text analysis, and there are a
number of use cases for which it’s not the best choice. It’s useful to be aware of
these.
The first category encompasses use cases for which a human is more
appropriate. When the data set is very small or very new, hand labeling can be
faster and more informative. Additionally, if the goal is to read all the records
and come up with a qualitative summary of key themes, a human is a better
choice.
The second category is when there’s a need to search for and retrieve specific
records that contain text strings with low latency. Tools like Elasticsearch or
Splunk have been developed to index strings for these use cases. Performance
will often be an issue with SQL and databases; this is one of the main reasons
that we usually try to structure the data into discrete columns that can more
easily be searched by the database engine.
The third category comprises tasks in the broader NLP category, where machine
learning approaches and the languages that run them, such as Python, are a better
choice. Sentiment analysis, used to analyze ranges of positive or negative
feelings in texts, can be handled only in a simplistic way with SQL. For
example, “love” and “hate” could be extracted and used to categorize records,
but given the range of words that can express positive and negative emotions, as
well as all the ways to negate those words, it would be nearly impossible to
create a rule set with SQL to handle them all. Part-of-speech tagging, where
words in a text are labeled as nouns, verbs, and so on, is better handled with
libraries available in Python. Language generation, or creating brand-new text

## Page 245

based on learnings from example texts, is another example best handled in other
tools. We will see how we can create new text by concatenating pieces of data
together, but SQL is still bound by rules and won’t automatically learn from and
adapt to new examples in the data set.
Now that we’ve discussed the many good reasons to use SQL for text analysis,
as well as the types of use cases to avoid, let’s take a look at the data set we’ll be
using for the examples before launching into the SQL code itself. 
The UFO Sightings Data Set
For the examples in this chapter, we’ll use a data set of UFO sightings compiled
by the National UFO Reporting Center. The data set consists of approximately
95,000 reports posted between 2006 and 2020. Reports come from individuals
who can enter information through an online form.
The table we will work with is ufo, and it has only two columns. The first is a
composite column called sighting_report that contains information about
when the sighting occurred, when it was reported, and when it was posted. It
also contains metadata about the location, shape, and duration of the sighting
event. The second column is a text field called description that contains the
full description of the event. Figure 5-1 shows a sample of the data.

## Page 246

Figure 5-1. Sample of the ufo table
Through the examples and discussion in this chapter, I will show how to parse
the first column into structured dates and descriptors. I will also show how to
perform various analyses on the description field. If I were working with
this data on a continual basis, I might consider creating an ETL pipeline, a job
that processes the data in the same way on a regular basis, and storing the
resulting structured data in a new table. For the examples in this chapter,
however, we’ll stick with the raw table.
Let’s get into the code, starting with SQL to explore and characterize the text
from the sightings.
Text Characteristics
The most flexible data type in a database is VARCHAR, because almost any data
can be put in fields of this type. As a result, text data in databases comes in a
variety of shapes and sizes. As with other data sets, profiling and characterizing

## Page 247

the data is one of the first things we do. From there we can develop a game plan
for the kinds of cleaning and parsing that may be necessary for the analysis.
One way we can get to know the text data is to find the number of characters in
each value, which can be done with the length function (or len in some
databases). This function takes the string or character field as an argument and is
similar to functions found in other languages and spreadsheet programs:
SELECT length('Sample string');
length
------

We can create a distribution of field lengths to get a sense of the typical length
and of whether there are any extreme outliers that might need to be handled in
special ways:
SELECT length(sighting_report), count(*) as records
FROM ufo
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
;
 
length  records
------  -------
90      1
91      4
92      8
...     ...
We can see in Figure 5-2 that most of the records are between roughly 150 and
180 characters long, and very few are less than 140 or more than 200 characters.
The lengths of the description field range from 5 to 64,921 characters. We
can assume that there is much more variety in this field, even before doing any
additional profiling.

## Page 248

Figure 5-2. Distribution of field lengths in the first column of the ufo table
Let’s take a look at a few sample rows of the sighting_report column. In a
query tool, I might scroll through a hundred or so rows to get familiar with the
contents, but these are representative of the values in the column:
Occurred : 3/4/2018 19:07 (Entered as : 03/04/18 19:07)Reported:

SphereDuration:

This data is what I would call semistructured, or overstuffed. It can’t be used in
an analysis as is, but there are clearly distinct pieces of information stored here,

## Page 249

and the pattern is similar between rows. For example, each row has the word
“Occurred” followed by what looks like a timestamp, “Location” followed by a
place, and “Duration” followed by an amount of time.
NOTE
Data can end up in overstuffed fields for a variety of reasons, but there are two common ones I
see. One is when there aren’t enough fields available in the source system or application to
store all the attributes required, so multiple attributes are entered into the same field. Another
is when the data is stored in a JSON blob in an application in order to accommodate sparse
attributes or frequent additions of new attributes. Although both scenarios are less than ideal
from an analysis perspective, as long as there is a consistent structure, we can usually handle
these with SQL.
Our next step is to make this field more usable by parsing it into several new
fields, each of which contains a single piece of information. The steps in this
process are:
Plan the field(s) desired as output
Apply parsing functions
Apply transformations, including data type conversions
Check the results when applied to the entire data set, since there will
often be some records that don’t conform to the pattern
Repeat these steps until the data is in the desired columns and formats
The new columns we will parse out of sighting_report are occurred,
entered_as, reported, posted, location, shape, and duration.
Next, we will learn about parsing functions and work on structuring the ufo
data set.
Text Parsing
Parsing data with SQL is the process of extracting pieces of a text value to make
them more useful for analysis. Parsing splits the data into the part that we want
and “everything else,” though typically our code returns only the part we want.

## Page 250

The simplest parsing functions return a fixed number of characters from either
the beginning or the end of a string. The left function returns characters from
the left side or beginning of the string, while the right function returns
characters from the right side or end of the string. They otherwise work in the
same way, taking the value to parse as the first argument and the number of
characters as the second. Either argument can be a database field or calculation,
allowing for dynamic results:
SELECT left('The data is about UFOs',3) as left_digits
,right('The data is about UFOs',4) as right_digits
;
left_digits  right_digits
-----------  -----
The          UFOs
In the ufo data set, we can parse out the first word, “Occurred,” using the left
function:
SELECT left(sighting_report,8) as left_digits
,count(*)
FROM ufo
GROUP BY 1
;
left_digits  count
-----------  -----
Occurred     95463
We can confirm that all records start with this word, which is good news because
it means at least this part of the pattern is consistent. However, what we really
want is the values for what occurred, not the word itself, so let’s try again. In the
first example record, the end of the occurred timestamp is at character 25. In
order to remove “Occurred” and retain only the actual timestamp, we can return
the rightmost 14 characters using the right function. Note that the right and
left functions are nested—the first argument of the right function is the
result of the left function:
SELECT right(left(sighting_report,25),14) as occurred
FROM ufo
;

## Page 251

occurred
--------------
3/4/2018 19:07
10/16/2017 21:
2/15/2018 00:1
...
Although this returns the correct result for the first record, it unfortunately can’t
handle the records that have two-digit month or day values. We could increase
the number of characters returned by the left and right functions, but the
result would then include too many characters for the first record.
The left and right functions are useful for extracting fixed-length parts of a
string, as in our extraction of the word “Occurred,” but for more complex
patterns, a function called split_part is more useful. The idea behind this
function is to split a string into parts based on a delimiter and then allow you to
select a specific part. A delimiter is one or more characters that are used to
specify the boundary between regions of text or other data. The comma delimiter
and tab delimiter are probably the most common, as these are used in text files
(with extensions such as .csv, .tsv, or .txt) to indicate where columns start and
end. However, any sequence of characters can be used, which will come in
handy for our parsing task. The form of the function is:
split_part(string or field name, delimiter, index)
The index is the position of the text to be returned, relative to the delimiter. So
index = 1 returns all of the text to the left of the first instance of the delimiter,
index = 2 returns the text between the first and second instance of the delimiter
(or all of the text to the right of the delimiter if the delimiter appears only once),
and so on. There is no zero index, and the values must be positive integers:
SELECT split_part('This is an example of an example string'
                  ,'an example'
                  ,1);
split_part
----------
This is 
SELECT split_part('This is an example of an example string'

## Page 252

,'an example'
                  ,2);
split_part
----------
 of
TIP
MySQL has a substring_index function instead of split_part. SQL Server does not
have a split_part function at all
Note that spaces in the text will be retained unless specified as part of the
delimiter. Let’s take a look at how we can parse the elements of the
sighting_report column. As a reminder, a sample value looks like this:
Occurred : 6/3/2014 23:00 (Entered as : 06/03/14 11:00)Reported: 
6/3/2014 10:33:24
PM 22:33Posted: 6/4/2014Location: Bethesda, MDShape: LightDuration:15 
minutes
The value we want our query to return is the text between “Occurred : ” and “
(Entered”. That is, we want the string “6/3/2014 23:00”. Checking the sample
text, “Occurred :” and “(Entered” both appear only once. A colon (:) appears
several times, both to separate the label from the value and in the middle of
timestamps. This might make parsing using the colon tricky. The open
parenthesis character appears only once. We have some choices as to what to
specify as the delimiter, choosing either longer strings or only the fewest
characters required to split the string accurately. I tend to be a little more verbose
to ensure that I get exactly the piece that I want, but it really depends on the
situation.
First, split sighting_report on “Occurred : ” and check the result:
SELECT split_part(sighting_report,'Occurred : ',2) as split_1
FROM ufo
;
split_1
--------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 253

22:33Posted: 6/4/2014Location: Bethesda, MDShape: LightDuration:15 
minutes
We have successfully removed the label, but we still have a lot of extra text
remaining. Let’s check the result when we split on “ (Entered”:
SELECT split_part(sighting_report,' (Entered',1) as split_2
FROM ufo
;
split_2
-------------------------
Occurred : 6/3/2014 23:00
This is closer, but it still has the label in the result. Fortunately, nesting
split_part functions will return only the desired date and time value:
SELECT split_part(
         split_part(sighting_report,' (Entered',1)
         ,'Occurred : ',2) as occurred
FROM ufo
;
occurred
---------------
6/3/2014 23:00
4/25/2014 21:15
5/25/2014
Now the result includes the desired values. Reviewing a few additional lines
shows that two-digit day and month values are handled appropriately, as are
dates that do not have a time value. It turns out that some records omit the
“Entered as” value, so one additional split is required to handle records where
the “Reported” label marks the end of the desired string:
SELECT 
split_part(
  split_part(
    split_part(sighting_report,' (Entered',1)
    ,'Occurred : ',2)
    ,'Reported',1) as occurred
FROM ufo

The most common occurred values parsed out with the SQL code are graphed
in Figure 5-3.

TIP
Finding a set of functions that works for all values in the data set is one of the hardest parts of
text parsing. It often takes several rounds of trial and error and profiling the results along the
way to get it right.

## Page 255

The next step is to apply similar parsing rules to extract the other desired fields,
using beginning and ending delimiters to isolate just the relevant part of the
string. The final query uses split_part several times, with different
arguments for each value:
SELECT 
  split_part(
    split_part(
      split_part(sighting_report,' (Entered',1)
      ,'Occurred : ',2)

## Page 256

With this SQL parsing, the data is now in a much more structured and usable
format. Before we finish, however, there are a few transformations that will
clean up the data a little further. We’ll take a look at these string transformation
functions next.
Text Transformations
Transformations change string values in some way. We saw a number of date
and timestamp transformation functions in Chapter 3. There is a set of functions
in SQL that specifically work on string values. These are useful for working with
parsed data, but also for any text data in a database that needs to be adjusted or
cleaned for analysis.
Among the most common transformations are the ones that change
capitalization. The upper function converts all letters to their uppercase form,
while the lower function converts all letters to their lowercase form. For
example:
SELECT upper('Some sample text');
upper
----------------
SOME SAMPLE TEXT
SELECT lower('Some sample text');
lower
----------------
some sample text
These are useful for standardizing values that may have been entered in different
ways. For example, any human will recognize that “California,” “caLiforNia,”
and “CALIFORNIA” all refer to the same state, but a database will treat them as
distinct values. If we were to count UFO sightings by states with these values,
we would end up with three records for California, resulting in incorrect analysis
conclusions. Converting them to all uppercase or all lowercase letters would
solve this problem. Some databases, including Postgres, have an initcap
function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string. This is useful for
proper nouns, such as state names:

## Page 257

SELECT initcap('caLiforNia'), initcap('golden gate bridge');
initcap     initcap
----------  ------------------
California  Golden Gate Bridge
The shape field in the data set we parsed contains one value that is in all
capitals, “TRIANGULAR.” To clean this and standardize it with the other
values, which all have only their first letter capitalized, apply the initcap
function:
SELECT distinct shape, initcap(shape) as shape_clean
FROM
(
    SELECT split_part(
             split_part(sighting_report,'Duration',1)
             ,'Shape: ',2) as shape
    FROM ufo
) a
;
shape       shape_clean
----------  -----------
...         ... 
Sphere      Sphere
TRIANGULAR  Triangular
Teardrop    Teardrop
...         ...
The number of sightings for each shape is shown in Figure 5-4. Light is by far
the most common shape, followed by circle and triangle. Some sightings do not
report a shape, so a count for null value appears in the graph as well.

## Page 258

Figure 5-4. Frequency of shapes in UFO sightings
Another useful transformation function is one called trim that removes blank
spaces at the beginning and end of a string. Extra whitespace characters are a
common problem when parsing values out of longer strings, or when data is
created by human entry or by copying data from one application to another. As

## Page 259

an example, we can remove the leading spaces before “California” in the
following string by using the trim function:
SELECT trim('  California  ');
trim
----------
California
The trim function has a few optional parameters that make it flexible for a
variety of data-cleaning challenges. First, it can remove characters from the start
of a string or from the end of a string, or both. Trimming from both ends is the
default, but the other options can be specified with leading or trailing.
Additionally, trim can remove any character, not just whitespace. So, for
example, if an application placed a dollar sign ($) at the beginning of each state
name for some reason, we could remove this with trim:
SELECT trim(leading '$' from '$California');
A few of the values in the duration field have leading spaces, so applying
trim will result in a cleaner output:
SELECT duration, trim(duration) as duration_clean
FROM
(
    SELECT split_part(sighting_report,'Duration:',2) as duration
    FROM ufo
) a
;
duration               duration_clean

 ~2 seconds            ~2 seconds
 15 minutes            15 minutes

Figure 5-5. Sightings lasting between 1 and 10 minutes are common. Some
sightings do not report a duration, so a count for null value appears in the graph.

The next type of transformation is a data type conversion. This type of
transformation, discussed in Chapter 2, will be useful for ensuring that the
results of our parsing have the intended data type. In our case, there are two
fields that should be treated as timestamps—the occurred and reported
columns—and the posted column should be a date type. The data types can be
changed with casting, using either the double colon (::) operator or the CAST
field as type syntax. We’ll leave the entered_as, location, shape,
and duration values as VARCHAR:

A sample of the data converts to the new formats. Notice that the database adds
the seconds to the timestamp, even though there were no seconds in the original
value, and correctly recognizes dates that were in month/day/year (mm/dd/yyyy)
format.  There is a problem when applying these transformations to the entire
data set, however. A few records do not have values at all, appearing as an empty
string, and some have the time value but no date associated with them. Although
an empty string and null seem to contain the same information—nothing—
databases treat them differently. An empty string is still a string and can’t be
converted to another data type. Setting all the nonconforming records to null
with a CASE statement allows the type conversion to work properly. Since we
know that dates must contain at least eight characters (four digits for year, one or

## Page 262

two digits each for month and day, and two “-” or “/” characters), one way to
accomplish this is by setting any record with LENGTH less than 8 equal to null
with a CASE statement:
SELECT 
case when occurred = '' then null 
     when length(occurred) < 8 then null
     else occurred::timestamp 
     end as occurred

The final transformation I’ll discuss in this section is the replace function.
Sometimes there is a word, phrase, or other string within a field that we would

## Page 263

like to change to another string or remove entirely. The replace function
comes in handy for this task. It takes three arguments—the original text, the
string to find, and the string to substitute in its place:
replace(string or field, string to find, string to substitute)
So, for example, if we want to change references of “unidentified flying objects”
to “UFOs,” we can use the replace function:
SELECT replace('Some unidentified flying objects were noticed
above...','unidentified flying objects','UFOs');
replace
-------------------------------
Some UFOs were noticed above...
This function will find and replace every instance of the string in the second
argument, regardless of where it appears. An empty string can be used as the
third argument, which is a good way to remove parts of a string that are not
wanted. Like other string functions, replace can be nested, with the output
from one replace becoming the input for another.
In the parsed UFO-sighting data set we’ve been working with, some of the
location values include qualifiers indicating that the sighting took place
“near,” “close to,” or “outside of” a city or town. We can use replace to
standardize these to “near”:
SELECT location
,replace(replace(location,'close to','near')
         ,'outside of','near') as location_clean
FROM
(
    SELECT split_part(split_part(sighting_report,'Shape',1)
                      ,'Location: ',2) as location
    FROM ufo
) a

field into distinct, appropriately typed columns. The final code looks like this:

     else occurred::timestamp 
     end as occurred

This piece of SQL code can be reused in other queries, or it can be used to copy

## Page 266

the raw UFO data into a new, cleaned-up table. Alternatively, it could be turned
into a view or put into a common table expression for reuse. Chapter 8 will
discuss these strategies in more detail.
We’ve seen how to apply parsing and transformation functions to clean and
improve the analysis value of text data that has some amount of structure in it.
Next, we’ll look at the other field in the UFO sightings data set, the free text
description field, and learn how to use SQL functions to search for specific
elements.
Finding Elements Within Larger Blocks of Text
Parsing and transformations are common operations applied to text data to
prepare it for analysis. Another common operation with text data is finding
strings within larger blocks of text. This can be done to filter results, categorize
records, or replace the searched-for strings with alternate values.
Wildcard Matches: LIKE, ILIKE
SQL has several functions for matching patterns within strings. The LIKE
operator matches the specified pattern within the string.  In order to allow it to
match a pattern and not just find an exact match, wildcard symbols can be added
before, after, or in the middle of the pattern. The “%” wildcard matches zero or
more characters, while the “_” wildcard matches exactly one character. If the
goal is to match the “%” or “_” itself, place the backslash escape symbol (“\”) in
front of that character:
SELECT 'this is an example string' like '%example%';
true
SELECT 'this is an example string' like '%abc%';
false
SELECT 'this is an example string' like '%this_is%';
true

## Page 267

The LIKE operator can be used in a number of clauses within the SQL
statement. It can be used to filter records in the WHERE clause. For example,
some reporters mention that they were with a spouse at the time, and so we
might want to find out how many reports mention the word “wife.” Since we
want to find the string anywhere in the description text, we’ll place the “%”
wildcard before and after “wife”:
SELECT count(*)
FROM ufo
WHERE description like '%wife%'
;
count
-----

We can see that more than six thousand reports mention “wife.” However, this
will return only matches on the lowercase string. What if some reporters mention
“Wife,” or they left Caps Lock on and typed in “WIFE” instead? There are two
options for making the search case insensitive. One option is to transform the
field to be searched using either the upper or lower function discussed in the
previous section, which has the effect of making the search case insensitive since
characters are all either uppercase or lowercase:
SELECT count(*)
FROM ufo
WHERE lower(description) like '%wife%'
;
count
-----

Another way to accomplish this is with the ILIKE operator, which is effectively
a case-insensitive LIKE operator. The drawback is that it is not available in
every database; notably, MySQL and SQL Server do not support it. However, it’s
a nice, compact syntax option if you are working in a database that does support
it:
SELECT count(*)

## Page 268

FROM ufo
WHERE description ilike '%wife%'
;
count
-----

Any of these variations of LIKE and ILIKE can be negated with NOT. So, for
example, to find the records that do not mention “wife,” we can use NOT LIKE:
SELECT count(*)
FROM ufo
WHERE lower(description) not like '%wife%'
;
count
-----

Filtering on multiple strings is possible with AND and OR operators:
SELECT count(*)
FROM ufo
WHERE lower(description) like '%wife%'
or lower(description) like '%husband%'
;
count
-----

Be careful to use parentheses to control the order of operations when using OR
in conjunction with AND operators, or you might get unexpected results. For
example, these WHERE clauses do not return the same result since OR is
evaluated before AND:
SELECT count(*)
FROM ufo
WHERE lower(description) like '%wife%'
or lower(description) like '%husband%'
and lower(description) like '%mother%'
;

## Page 269

count
-----

SELECT count(*)
FROM ufo
WHERE (lower(description) like '%wife%'
       or lower(description) like '%husband%'
       )
and lower(description) like '%mother%'
;
count
-----

In addition to filtering in WHERE or JOIN...ON clauses, LIKE can be used in the
SELECT clause to categorize or aggregate certain records. Let’s start with
categorization. The LIKE operator can be used within a CASE statement to label
and group records. Some of the descriptions mention an activity the observer
was doing during or prior to the sighting, such as driving or walking. We can
find out how many descriptions contain such terms by using a CASE statement
with LIKE:
SELECT 
case when lower(description) like '%driving%' then 'driving'
     when lower(description) like '%walking%' then 'walking'
     when lower(description) like '%running%' then 'running'
     when lower(description) like '%cycling%' then 'cycling'
     when lower(description) like '%swimming%' then 'swimming'
     else 'none' end as activity
,count(*)
FROM ufo
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
activity  count
--------  -----
none      77728
driving   11675
walking   4516
running   1306
swimming  196
cycling   42

## Page 270

The most common activity was driving, whereas not many people report
sightings while swimming or cycling. This is perhaps not surprising, since these
activities are simply less common than driving.
TIP
Although values derived through text-parsing transformation functions can be used in JOIN
criteria, database performance is often a problem. Consider parsing and/or transforming in a
subquery and then joining the result with an exact match in the JOIN clause.
Note that this CASE statement labels each description with only one of the
activities and evaluates whether each record matches the pattern in the order in
which the statement is written. A description that contains both “driving” and
“walking” will be labeled as “driving.” This is appropriate in many cases, but
particularly when analyzing longer text such as from reviews, survey comments,
or support tickets, the ability to label records with multiple categories is
important. For this type of use case, a series of binary or BOOLEAN flag
columns is called for.
We saw earlier that LIKE can be used to generate a BOOLEAN response of
TRUE or FALSE, and we can use this to label rows. In the data set, a number of
descriptions mention the direction in which the object was detected, such as
north or south, and some mention more than one direction. We might want to
label each record with a field indicating whether the description mentions each
direction:
SELECT description ilike '%south%' as south
,description ilike '%north%' as north
,description ilike '%east%' as east
,description ilike '%west%' as west
,count(*)
FROM ufo
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
ORDER BY 1,2,3,4
;
south  north  east   west   count
-----  -----  ----   -----  -----
false  false  false  false  43757
false  false  false  true   3963

## Page 271

false  false  true   false  5724
false  false  true   true   4202
false  true   false  false  4048
false  true   false  true   2607
false  true   true   false  3299

true   false  true   true   2491
true   true   false  false  3440
true   true   false  true   2064
true   true   true   false  2684
true   true   true   true   5293
The result is a matrix of BOOLEANs that can be used to find the frequency of
various combinations of directions, or to find when a direction is used without
any of the other directions in the same description.
All of the combinations are useful in some contexts, particularly in building data
sets that will be used by others to explore the data, or in a BI or visualization
tool. However, sometimes it is more useful to summarize the data further and
perform an aggregation on the records that contain a string pattern. Here we will
count the records, but other aggregations such as sum and average can be
used if the data set contains other numerical fields, such as sales figures:
SELECT 
count(case when description ilike '%south%' then 1 end) as south
,count(case when description ilike '%north%' then 1 end) as north
,count(case when description ilike '%west%' then 1 end) as west
,count(case when description ilike '%east%' then 1 end) as east
FROM ufo
;
south  north  west   east
-----  -----  -----  -----
25271  26027  25783  29326
We now have a much more compact summary of the frequency of direction
terms in the description field, and we can see that “east” is mentioned more often
than other directions. The results are graphed in Figure 5-7.

## Page 272

Figure 5-7. Frequency of compass directions mentioned in UFO sighting reports
In the preceding query, we still allow a record that contains more than one
direction to be counted more than once. However, there is no longer visibility
into which specific combinations exist. Complexity can be added into the query
as needed to handle such cases, with a statement such as:

## Page 273

count(case when description ilike '%east%' 
and description ilike '%north%' then 1 end) as east
Pattern matching with LIKE, NOT LIKE, and ILIKE is flexible and can be used
in various places in a SQL query to filter, categorize, and aggregate data for a
variety of output needs. These operators can be used in combination with the
text-parsing and transformation functions we discussed earlier for even more
flexibility. Next, I’ll discuss handling multiple elements when the matches are
exact before returning to more patterns in a discussion of regular expressions.
Exact Matches: IN, NOT IN
Before we move on to more complex pattern matching with regular expressions,
it’s worth looking at a couple of additional operators that are useful in text
analysis. Although not strictly about pattern matching, they are often useful in
combination with LIKE and its relatives in order to come up with a rule set that
includes exactly the right set of results. The operators are IN and its negation,
NOT IN. These allow you to specify a list of matches, resulting in more compact
code.
Let’s imagine we are interested in categorizing the sightings based on the first
word of the description. We can find the first word using the
split_part function, with a space character as the delimiter. Many reports
start with a color as the first word. We might want to filter the records in order to
take a look at reports that start by naming a color. This can be done by listing
each color with an OR construction:
SELECT first_word, description
FROM
(
    SELECT split_part(description,' ',1) as first_word
    ,description
    FROM ufo
) a
WHERE first_word = 'Red'
or first_word = 'Orange'
or first_word = 'Yellow'
or first_word = 'Green'
or first_word = 'Blue'
or first_word = 'Purple'
or first_word = 'White'

## Page 274

White       White dot of light traveled across the sky, very...
Blue        Blue Beam project known seen from the high desert... 
...         ...
Using an IN list is more compact and often less error-prone, particularly when
there are other elements in the WHERE clause. IN takes a comma-separated list
of items to match. The data type of elements should match the data type of the
column. If the data type is numeric, the elements should be numbers; if the data
type is text, the elements should be quoted as text (even if the element is a
number):
SELECT first_word, description
FROM
(
    SELECT split_part(description,' ',1) as first_word
    ,description
    FROM ufo
) a
WHERE first_word in 
('Red','Orange','Yellow','Green','Blue','Purple','White')
;

...         ...
The two forms are identical in their results, and the frequencies are shown in
Figure 5-8.

## Page 275

Figure 5-8. Frequency of select colors used as the first word in UFO sighting descriptions
The main benefit of IN and NOT IN is that they make code more compact and
readable. This can come in handy when creating more complex categorizations
in the SELECT clause. For example, imagine we wanted to categorize and count
the records by the first word into colors, shapes, movements, or other possible
words. We might come up with something like the following that combines
elements of parsing, transformations, pattern matching, and IN lists:
SELECT 
case when lower(first_word) in ('red','orange','yellow','green', 
'blue','purple','white') then 'Color'
when lower(first_word) in ('round','circular','oval','cigar') 
then 'Shape'
when first_word ilike 'triang%' then 'Shape'
when first_word ilike 'flash%' then 'Motion'
when first_word ilike 'hover%' then 'Motion'
when first_word ilike 'pulsat%' then 'Motion'
else 'Other' 
end as first_word_type
,count(*)
FROM
(
    SELECT split_part(description,' ',1) as first_word
    ,description

## Page 276

) a
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;

Of course, given the nature of this data set, it would likely take many more lines
of code and rules to accurately categorize the reports by first word. SQL allows
you to create a variety of complex and nuanced expressions to deal with text
data. Next, we’ll turn to some even more sophisticated ways to work with text
data in SQL, using regular expressions.
Regular Expressions
There are a number of ways to match patterns in SQL. One of the most powerful
methods, though it is also confusing, is the use of regular expressions (regex). I
will admit to finding regular expressions intimidating, and I avoided using them
for a long time in my data analysis career. In a pinch, I was lucky enough to have
colleagues who were willing to share code snippets and get my work unstuck. It
was only when I ended up with a big text analysis project that I decided it was
finally time to learn about them.
Regular expressions are sequences of characters, many with special meanings,
that define search patterns. The main challenge in learning regex, and in using
and maintaining code that contains it, is that the syntax is not particularly
intuitive. Code snippets don’t read anything like a human language, or even like
computer languages such as SQL or Python. With a working knowledge of the
special characters, however, the code can be written and deciphered. Like the
code for all our queries, it’s a good idea to start simple, build in complexity as
needed, and check results as you go. And leave comments liberally, both for
other analysts and for future you.
Regex is a language, but it’s one that is used only within other languages. For

## Page 277

example, regular expressions can be called within Java, Python, and SQL, but
there is no independent way to program with them. All major databases have
some implementation of regex. The syntax isn’t always exactly the same, but as
with other functions, once you have a sense of the possibilities, adjusting syntax
to your environment should be possible.
A full explanation, and all of the syntax and ways to use regex, is beyond the
scope of this book, but I’ll show you enough for you to get started and
accomplish a number of common tasks in SQL. For a more thorough
introduction, Learning Regular Expressions by Ben Forta (O’Reilly) is a good
choice. Here I’ll start by introducing the ways to indicate to the database that
you are using a regex, and then I’ll introduce the syntax, before moving on to
some examples of how regex can be useful in the UFO sighting reports analysis.
Regex can be used in SQL statements in a couple of ways. The first is with
POSIX comparators, and the second is with regex functions. POSIX stands for
Portable Operating System Interface and refers to a set of IEEE standards, but
you don’t need to know any more than that to use POSIX comparators in your
SQL code. The first comparator is the ~ (tilde) symbol, which compares two
statements and returns TRUE if one string is contained in the other. As a simple
example, we can check to see whether the string “The data is about UFOs”
contains the string “data”:
SELECT 'The data is about UFOs' ~ 'data' as comparison;
comparison
----------
true
The return value is a BOOLEAN, TRUE or FALSE. Note that, although it
doesn’t contain any special syntax, “data” is a regex. Regular expressions can
also contain normal text strings. This example is similar to what could be
accomplished with a LIKE operator. The ~ comparator is case sensitive. To
make it case insensitive, similar to ILIKE, use ~* (the tilde followed by an
asterisk):
SELECT 'The data is about UFOs' ~* 'DATA' as comparison;
comparison

## Page 278

----------
true
To negate the comparator, place an ! (exclamation point) before the tilde or tilde-
asterisk combination:
SELECT 'The data is about UFOs' !~ 'alligators' as comparison;
comparison
----------
true
Table 5-1 summarizes the four POSIX comparators.
Table 5-1. POSIX comparators

!~

contained in the other

Now that we have a way to introduce regex into our SQL, let’s get familiar with
some of the special pattern-matching syntax it offers. The first special character
to know is the . (period) symbol, a wildcard that is used to match any single
character:
SELECT 
'The data is about UFOs' ~ '. data' as comparison_1
,'The data is about UFOs' ~ '.The' as comparison_2
;

Let’s break this down in order to understand what’s going on and develop our

## Page 279

intuition about how regex works. In the first comparison, the pattern tries to
match any character, indicated by the period, a space, and then the word “data.”
This pattern matches the string “e data” in the example sentence, so TRUE is
returned. If this seems counterintuitive, since there are additional characters
before the letter “e” and after the word “data,” remember that the comparator is
only looking for this pattern somewhere within the string, similar to a LIKE
operator. In the second comparison, the pattern tries to match any character
followed by “The.” Since in the example sentence “The” is the start of the string
and there are no characters before it, the value FALSE is returned.
To match multiple characters, use the * (asterisk) symbol. This will match zero
or more characters, similar to using the % (percent) symbol in a LIKE
statement.  This use of the asterisk is different from placing it immediately after
the tilde (~*), which makes the match case insensitive. Notice, however, that in
this case “%” is not a wildcard and is instead treated as a literal character to be
matched:
SELECT 'The data is about UFOs' ~ 'data *' as comparison_1
,'The data is about UFOs' ~ 'data %' as comparison_2
;
comparison_1  comparison_2
------------  ------------
true          false
The next special characters to know are [ and ] (left and right brackets). These
are used to enclose a set of characters, any one of which must match. The
brackets match a single character even though multiple characters can be
between them, though we’ll see shortly how to match more than one time. One
use for the brackets is to make part of a pattern case insensitive by enclosing the
uppercase and lowercase letters within the brackets (do not use a comma, as that
would match the comma character itself):
SELECT 'The data is about UFOs' ~ '[Tt]he' as comparison;
comparison
----------
true

## Page 280

In this example, the pattern will match either “the” or “The”; since this string
starts the example sentence, the statement returns the value TRUE. This isn’t
quite the same thing as the case-insensitive match ~*, because in this case
variations such as “tHe” and “THE” do not match the pattern:
SELECT 'The data is about UFOs' ~ '[Tt]he' as comparison_1
,'the data is about UFOs' ~ '[Tt]he' as comparison_2
,'tHe data is about UFOs' ~ '[Tt]he' as comparison_3
,'THE data is about UFOs' ~ '[Tt]he' as comparison_4
;
comparison_1  comparison_2  comparison_3  comparison_4
------------  ------------  ------------  ------------
true          true          false         false
Another use of the bracket set match is to match a pattern that includes a
number, allowing for any number. For example, imagine we wanted to match
any description that mentions “7 minutes,” “8 minutes,” or “9 minutes.” This
could be accomplished with a CASE statement with several LIKE operators, but
with regex the pattern syntax is more compact:
SELECT 'sighting lasted 8 minutes' ~ '[789] minutes' as comparison;
comparison
----------
true
To match any number, we could enclose all the digits between the brackets:
[0123456789]
However, regex allows a range of characters to be entered with a - (dash)
separator.  All of the numbers can be indicated by [0-9]. Any smaller range of
numbers can be used as well, such as [0-3] or [4-9]. This pattern, with a range, is
equivalent to the last example that listed out each number:
SELECT 'sighting lasted 8 minutes' ~ '[7-9] minutes' as comparison;
comparison
----------
true

## Page 281

Ranges of letters can be matched in a similar way. Table 5-2 summarizes the
range patterns that are most useful in SQL analysis. Nonnumber and nonletter
values can also be placed between brackets, as in [$%@].
Table 5-2. Regex range patterns
Range pattern
Purpose
[0-9]
Match any number
[a-z]
Match any lowercase letter
[A-Z]
Match any uppercase letter
[A-Za-z0-9]
Match any lower- or uppercase letter, or any number
[A-z]
Match any ASCII character; generally not used because it matches everything, 
including symbols
If the desired pattern match contains more than one instance of a particular value
or type of value, one option is to include as many ranges as needed, one after the
other. For example, we can match a three-digit number by repeating the number
range notation three times:
SELECT 'driving on 495 south' ~ 'on [0-9][0-9][0-9]' as comparison;
comparison
----------
true
Another option is to use one of the optional special syntaxes for repeating a
pattern multiple times. This can be useful when you don’t know exactly how
many times the pattern will repeat, but be careful to check the results to make
sure you don’t accidentally return more matches than intended. To match one or
more times, place the + (plus) symbol after the pattern:
SELECT 
'driving on 495 south' ~ 'on [0-9]+' as comparison_1
,'driving on 1 south' ~ 'on [0-9]+' as comparison_2
,'driving on 38east' ~ 'on [0-9]+' as comparison_3
,'driving on route one' ~ 'on [0-9]+' as comparison_4
;
comparison_1  comparison_2  comparison_3  comparison_4
------------  ------------  ------------  ------------

## Page 282

true          true          true          false
Table 5-3 summarizes the other options for indicating the number of times to
repeat a pattern.
Table 5-3. Regex patterns for matching a character set multiple times; in each 
case, the symbol or symbols are placed immediately after the set expression
Symbol
Purpose
+
Match the character set one or more times
*
Match the character set zero or more times
?
Match the character set zero or one time
{ }
Match the character set the number of times specified between the curly braces; for 
example, {3} matches exactly three times
{ , }
Match the character set any number of times in a range specified by the comma-
separated numbers between the curly braces; for example, {3,5} matches between 
three and five times
Sometimes rather than matching a pattern, we want to find items that do not
match a pattern. This can be done by placing the ^ (caret) symbol before the
pattern, which serves to negate the pattern:
SELECT 
'driving on 495 south' ~ 'on [0-9]+' as comparison_1
,'driving on 495 south' ~ 'on ^[0-9]+' as comparison_2
,'driving on 495 south' ~ '^on [0-9]+' as comparison_3
;
comparison_1  comparison_2  comparison_3
------------  ------------  ------------ 
true          false         false
We might want to match a pattern that includes one of the special characters, so
we need a way to tell the database to check for that literal character and not treat
it as special. To do this, we need an escape character, which is the \ (backslash)
symbol in regex:
SELECT 
'"Is there a report?" she asked' ~ '\?' as comparison_1
,'it was filed under ^51.' ~ '^[0-9]+' as comparison_2

## Page 283

,'it was filed under ^51.' ~ '\^[0-9]+' as comparison_3
;
comparison_1  comparison_2  comparison_3
------------  ------------  ------------ 
true          false         true
In the first line, omitting the backslash before the question mark causes the
database to return an “invalid regular expression” error (the exact wording of the
error may be different depending on the database type). In the second line, even
though ^ is followed by one or more digits ([0-9]+), the database interprets the ^
in the comparison '^[0-9]+' to be a negation and will evaluate whether the
string does not include the specified digits. The third line escapes the caret with
a backslash, and the database now interprets this as the literal ^ character.
Text data usually includes whitespace characters. These range from the space,
which our eyes notice, to the subtle and sometimes unprinted tab and newline
characters. We will see later how to replace these with regex, but for now let’s
stick to how to match them in a regex. Tabs are matched with \t. Newlines are
matched with \r for a carriage return or \n for a line feed, and depending on the
operating system, sometimes both are required: \r\n. Experiment with your
environment by running a few simple queries to see what returns the desired
result. To match any whitespace character, use \s, but note that this also matches
the space character:
SELECT 
'spinning
flashing
and whirling' ~ '\n' as comparison_1
,'spinning
flashing
and whirling' ~ '\s' as comparison_2
,'spinning flashing' ~ '\s' as comparison_3
,'spinning' ~ '\s' as comparison_4
;  
comparison_1  comparison_2  comparison_3  comparison_4
------------  ------------  ------------  ------------
true          true          true          false
TIP

## Page 284

SQL query tools or SQL query parsers may have trouble interpreting new lines typed directly
into them and thus may return an error. If this is the case, try copying and pasting the text from
the source rather than typing it in. All SQL query tools should be able to work with newlines
that exist in a database table, however.
Similar to mathematical expressions, parentheses can be used to enclose
expressions that should be treated together. For example, we might want to
match a somewhat complex pattern that repeats several times:
SELECT 
'valid codes have the form 12a34b56c' ~ '([0-9]{2}[a-z]){3}' 
  as comparison_1
,'the first code entered was 123a456c' ~ '([0-9]{2}[a-z]){3}' 
  as comparison_2
,'the second code entered was 99x66y33z' ~ '([0-9]{2}[a-z]){3}' 
  as comparison_3
;
comparison_1  comparison_2  comparison_3
------------  ------------  ------------
true          false          true
All three lines use the same regex pattern, '([0-9]{2}[a-z]){3}', for
matching. The pattern inside the parentheses, [0-9]{2}[a-z], looks for two
digits followed by a lowercase letter. Outside of the parentheses, {3} indicates
that the whole pattern should be repeated three times. The first line follows this
pattern, since it contains the string 12a34b56c. The second line does not match
the pattern; it does have two digits followed by a lowercase letter (23a) and then
two more digits (23a45), but this second repetition is followed by a third digit
rather than by another lowercase letter (23a456), so there is no match. The
third line has a matching pattern, 99x66y33z.
As we’ve just seen, regex can be used in any number of combinations with other
expressions, both regex and normal text, to create pattern-matching code. In
addition to specifying what to match, regex can be used to specify where to
match. Use the special character \y to match a pattern starting at the beginning or
end of a word (in some databases, this might be \b instead). As an example,
imagine we were interested in finding the word “car” in the UFO sighting
reports. We could write an expression like this:

## Page 285

SELECT 
'I was in my car going south toward my home' ~ 'car' as comparison;
comparison
----------
true
It finds “car” in the string and returns TRUE as expected. However, let’s look at
a few more strings from the data set, looking for the same expression:
SELECT 
'I was in my car going south toward my home' ~ 'car' 
  as comparison_1
,'UFO scares cows and starts stampede breaking' ~ 'car' 
  as comparison_2
,'I''m a carpenter and married father of 2.5 kids' ~ 'car' 
  as comparison_3
,'It looked like a brown boxcar way up into the sky' ~ 'car' 
  as comparison_4
;
comparison_1  comparison_2  comparison_3  comparison_4
------------  ------------  ------------  ------------
true          true          true          true
All of these strings match the pattern “car” as well, even though “scares,”
“carpenter,” and “boxcar” aren’t exactly what was intended when we went
looking for mentions of cars. To fix this, we can add \y to the beginning and end
of the “car” pattern in our expression:
SELECT 
'I was in my car going south toward my home' ~ '\ycar\y' 
  as comparison_1
,'UFO scares cows and starts stampede breaking' ~ '\ycar\y' 
  as comparison_2
,'I''m a carpenter and married father of 2.5 kids' ~ '\ycar\y' 
  as comparison_3
,'It looked like a brown boxcar way up into the sky' ~ '\ycar\y' 
  as comparison_4
;
comparison_1  comparison_2  comparison_3  comparison_4
------------  ------------  ------------  ------------
true          false         false         false

## Page 286

Of course, in this simple example, we could have simply added spaces before
and after the word “car” with the same result. The benefit of the pattern is that it
will also pick up cases in which the pattern is at the beginning of a string and
thus does not have a leading space:
SELECT 'Car lights in the sky passing over the highway' ~* '\ycar\y' 
 as comparison_1
,'Car lights in the sky passing over the highway' ~* ' car ' 
 as comparison_2
;
comparison_1  comparison_2
------------  ------------
true          false
The pattern '\ycar\y' makes a case-insensitive match when “Car” is the first
word, but the pattern ' car ' does not. To match the  beginning of an entire
string, use the \A special character, and to match the end of a string, use \Z:
SELECT 
'Car lights in the sky passing over the highway' ~* '\Acar\y' 
  as comparison_1
,'I was in my car going south toward my home' ~* '\Acar\y' 
  as comparison_2
,'An object is sighted hovering in place over my car' ~* '\ycar\Z' 
  as comparison_3
,'I was in my car going south toward my home' ~* '\ycar\Z' 
  as comparison_4
;
comparison_1  comparison_2  comparison_3  comparison_4
------------  ------------  ------------  ------------
true          false         true          false
In the first line, the pattern matches “Car” at the beginning of the string. The
second line starts with “I,” so the pattern does not match. In the third line, the
pattern is looking for “car” at the end of the string and does match it. Finally, in
the fourth line, the last word is “home,” so the pattern does not match.
If this is your first time working with regular expressions, it may take a few
read-throughs and some experimentation in your SQL editor to get the hang of
them. There’s nothing like working with real examples to help solidify learning,

## Page 287

so next I’ll go through some applications to our UFO sightings analysis, and I’ll
also introduce a couple of specific regex SQL functions.
NOTE
Regular expression implementations vary widely by database vendor. The POSIX operators in
this section work in Postgres and in databases derived from Postgres such as Amazon Redshift,
but not necessarily in others.
An alternative to the ~ operator is the rlike or regexp_like function (depending on the
database). These have the following format:
regexp_like(string, pattern, optional_parameters)
The first example in this section would be written as:
SELECT regexp_like('The data is about UFOs','data') 
 as comparison;
The optional parameters control matching type, such as whether the match is case insensitive.
Many of these databases have additional functions not covered here, such as
regexp_substr to find matching substrings, and regexp_count to find the number of
times a pattern is matched. Postgres supports POSIX but unfortunately does not support these
other functions. Organizations that expect to do a lot of text analysis will do well to choose a
database type with a robust set of regular expression functions.
Finding and replacing with regex
In the previous section, we discussed regular expressions and how to construct
patterns with regex to match parts of strings in our data sets. Let’s apply this
technique to the UFO sightings data set to see how it works in practice. Along
the way, I’ll also introduce some additional regex SQL functions.
The sighting reports contain a variety of details, such as what the reporter was
doing at the time of the sighting and when and where they were doing it.
Another detail commonly mentioned is seeing some number of lights. As a first
example, let’s find the descriptions that contain a number and the word “light” or
“lights.” For the sake of display in this book, I’ll just check the first 100
characters, but this code can also work across the entire description field:
SELECT left(description,50)

## Page 288

FROM ufo
WHERE left(description,50) ~ '[0-9]+ light[s ,.]'
;
left
--------------------------------------------------
Was walking outside saw 5 lights in a line changed
2 lights about 5 mins apart, goin from west to eas
Black triangular aircraft with 3 lights hovering a
...
The regular expression pattern matches any number of digits ([0-9]+), followed
by a space, then the string “light”, and finally either a letter “s,” a space, a
comma, or a period. In addition to finding the relevant records, we might want to
split out just the part that refers to the number and the word “lights.” To do this,
we’ll use the regex function regexp_matches.
TIP
Regex function support varies widely by database vendor and sometimes by database software
version. SQL Server does not support the functions, while MySQL has minimal support for
them. Analytic databases such as Redshift, Snowflake, and Vertica support a variety of useful
functions. Postgres has only match and replace functions. Explore the documentation for your
database for specific function availability.
The regexp_matches function takes two arguments: a string to search and a
regex match pattern. It returns an array of the string(s) that matched the pattern.
If there are no matches, a null value is returned. Since the return value is an
array, we’ll use an index of [1] to return just a single value as a VARCHAR,
which will allow for additional string manipulation as needed. If you are
working in another type of database, the regexp_substr function is similar
to regexp_matches, but it returns a VARCHAR value, so there is no need to
add the [1] index.
TIP
An array is a collection of objects stored together in the computer’s memory. In databases,
arrays are enclosed in { } (curly braces), and this is a good way to spot that something in the
database is not one of the regular data types we’ve been working with so far. Arrays have some
advantages when storing and retrieving data, but they are not as easy to work with in SQL

## Page 289

since they require special syntax. Elements in an array are accessed using [ ] (square brackets)
notation. For our purposes here, it’s enough to know that the first element is found with [1], the
second with [2], and so on.
Building on our example, we can parse the desired value, the number, and the
word “light(s)” from the description field and then GROUP BY this value and the
most common variations:
SELECT (regexp_matches(description,'[0-9]+ light[s ,.]'))[1]
,count(*)
FROM ufo
WHERE description ~ '[0-9]+ light[s ,.]'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
; 
regexp_matches  count
--------------  -----
3 lights        1263
2 lights        565
4 lights        549
...             ...
The top 10 results are graphed in Figure 5-9.

## Page 290

Figure 5-9. Number of lights mentioned at the beginning of UFO sighting descriptions
Reports mentioning three lights are more than twice as common as the second
most often mentioned number of lights, and from two to six lights are most
commonly seen. To find the full range of the number of lights, we can parse the
matched text and then find the min and max values:
SELECT min(split_part(matched_text,' ',1)::int) as min_lights
,max(split_part(matched_text,' ',1)::int) as max_lights
FROM
(
    SELECT (regexp_matches(description
                           ,'[0-9]+ light[s ,.]')
                           )[1] as matched_text
    ,count(*)
    FROM ufo
    WHERE description ~ '[0-9]+ light[s ,.]'
    GROUP BY 1
) a
; 
min_lights  max_lights
----------  -----

## Page 291

0           2000
At least one report mentions two thousand lights, and the minimum value of zero
lights is also mentioned. We might want to review these reports further to see if
there is anything else interesting or unusual about these extreme values.
In addition to finding matches, we might want to replace the matched text with
some alternate text. This is particularly useful when trying to clean a data set of
text that has multiple spellings for the same underlying thing. The
regexp_replace function can accomplish this. It is similar to the replace
function discussed earlier in the chapter, but it can take a regular expression
argument as the pattern to match. The syntax is similar to the replace
function:
regexp_replace(field or string, pattern, replacement value)
Let’s put this to work to try to clean up the duration field that we parsed out
of the sighting_report column earlier. This appears to be a free text entry
field, and there are more than eight thousand different values. However,
inspection reveals that there are common themes—most refer to some
combination of seconds, minutes, and hours:
SELECT split_part(sighting_report,'Duration:',2) as duration
,count(*) as reports
FROM ufo
GROUP BY 1
;
duration    reports
--------    -------
10 minutes  4571
1 hour      1599
10 min      333
10 mins     150
>1 hour     113
...         ...
Within this sample, the durations of “10 minutes,” “10 min,” and “10 mins” all
represent the same amount of time, but the database doesn’t know to combine
them because the spellings are slightly different. We could use a series of nested

## Page 292

replace functions to convert all these different spellings. However, we would
also have to take into account other variations, such as capitalizations. Regex is
handy in this situation, allowing us to create more compact code. The first step is
to develop a pattern that matches the desired string, which we can do with the
regexp_matches function. It’s a good idea to review this intermediate step to
make sure we’re matching the correct text:
SELECT duration
,(regexp_matches(duration
                 ,'\m[Mm][Ii][Nn][A-Za-z]*\y')
                 )[1] as matched_minutes
FROM
(
    SELECT split_part(sighting_report,'Duration:',2) as duration
    ,count(*) as reports
    FROM ufo
    GROUP BY 1
) a
;
duration      matched_minutes
------------  ---------------
10 min.       min
10 minutes+   minutes
10 min        min
10 minutes +  minutes
10 minutes?   minutes
10 minutes    minutes
10 mins       mins
...           ...
Let’s break this down. In the subquery, the duration value is split out of the
sighting_report field. Then the regexp_matches function looks for
strings that match the pattern:
'\m[Mm][Ii][Nn][A-Za-z]*\y'
This pattern starts at the beginning of a word (\m) and then looks for any
sequence of the letters “m,” “i,” and “n,” regardless of capitalization ([Mm] and
so on). Next, it looks for zero or more instances of any other lowercase or
uppercase letter ([A-Za-z]*), and then it finally checks for the end of a word (\y)
so that only the word that includes the variation of “minutes” is included and not

## Page 293

the rest of the string. Notice that the “+” and “?” characters are not matched.
With this pattern, we can now replace all these variations with the standard value
“min”:
SELECT duration
,(regexp_matches(duration
                 ,'\m[Mm][Ii][Nn][A-Za-z]*\y')
                 )[1] as matched_minutes
,regexp_replace(duration
                 ,'\m[Mm][Ii][Nn][A-Za-z]*\y'
                 ,'min') as replaced_text
FROM
(
    SELECT split_part(sighting_report,'Duration:',2) as duration
    ,count(*) as reports
    FROM ufo
    GROUP BY 1
) a
;
duration      matched_minutes  replaced_text
-----------   ---------------  -------------
10 min.       min              10 min.
10 minutes+   minutes          10 min+
10 min        min              10 min
10 minutes +  minutes          10 min +
10 minutes?   minutes          10 min?
10 minutes    minutes          10 min
10 mins       mins             10 min
...           ...              ...
The values in the replaced_text column are much more standardized now.
The period, plus, and question mark characters could also be replaced by
enhancing the regex. From an analytical standpoint, however, we might want to
consider how to represent the uncertainty that the plus and question mark
represent. The regexp_replace functions can be nested in order to achieve
replacement of different parts or types of strings. For example, we can
standardize both the minutes and the hours:
SELECT duration
,(regexp_matches(duration
                 ,'\m[Hh][Oo][Uu][Rr][A-Za-z]*\y')
                 )[1] as matched_hour
,(regexp_matches(duration

## Page 294

,'\m[Mm][Ii][Nn][A-Za-z]*\y')
                 )[1] as matched_minutes
,regexp_replace(
        regexp_replace(duration
                       ,'\m[Mm][Ii][Nn][A-Za-z]*\y'
                       ,'min') 
        ,'\m[Hh][Oo][Uu][Rr][A-Za-z]*\y'
        ,'hr') as replaced_text
FROM
(
    SELECT split_part(sighting_report,'Duration:',2) as duration
    ,count(*) as reports
    FROM ufo
    GROUP BY 1
) a
;
duration             matched_hour  matched_minutes  replaced_text
-------------------  ------------  ---------------  -------------
1 Hour 15 min        Hour          min              1 hr 15 min
1 hour & 41 minutes  hour          minutes          1 hr & 41 min
1 hour 10 mins       hour          mins             1 hr 10 min
1 hour 10 minutes    hour          minutes          1 hr 10 min
...                  ...           ...              ...
The regex for hours is similar to the one for minutes, looking for case-insensitive
matches of “hour” at the beginning of a word, followed by zero or more other
letter characters before the end of the word. The intermediate hour and minutes
matches may not be needed in the final result, but I find them helpful to review
as I’m developing my SQL code to prevent errors later. A full cleaning of the
duration column would likely involve many more lines of code, and it’s all
too easy to lose track and introduce a typo.
The regexp_replace function can be nested any number of times, or it can
be combined with the basic replace function. Another use for
regexp_replace is in CASE statements, for targeted replacement when
conditions in the statement are met. Regex is a powerful and flexible tool within
SQL that, as we’ve seen, can be used in a number of ways within an overall SQL
query.
In this section, I’ve introduced a number of ways to search for, find, and replace
specific elements within longer texts, from wildcard matches with LIKE to IN
lists and more complex pattern matching with regex. All of these, along with the

## Page 295

text-parsing and transformation functions introduced earlier, allow us to create
customized rule sets with as much complexity as needed to handle the data sets
in hand. It’s worth keeping in mind the balance between complexity and
maintenance burden, however. For one-time analysis of a data set, it can be
worth the trouble to create complex rule sets that perfectly clean the data. For
ongoing reporting and monitoring, it’s usually worthwhile to explore options for
receiving cleaner data from data sources. Next, we’ll turn to several ways to
construct new text strings with SQL: using constants, existing strings, and parsed
strings.
Constructing and Reshaping Text
We’ve seen how to parse, transform, find, and replace elements of strings in
order to perform a variety of cleaning and analysis tasks with SQL. In addition
to these, SQL can be used to generate new combinations of text. In this section,
I’ll first discuss concatenation, which allows different fields and types of data to
be consolidated into a single field. Then I’ll discuss changing text shape with
functions that combine multiple columns into a single row, as well as the
opposite: breaking up a single string into multiple rows.
Concatenation
New text can be created with SQL with concatenation. Any combination of
constant or hardcoded text, database fields, and calculations on those fields can
be joined together. There are a few ways to concatenate. Most databases support
the concat function, which takes as arguments the fields or values to be
concatenated:
concat(value1, value2)
concat(value1, value2, value3...)
Some databases support the concat_ws (concatenate with separator) function,
which takes a separator value as the first argument, followed by the list of values
to concatenate. This is useful when there are multiple values that you want to put
together, using a comma, dash, or similar element to separate them:

## Page 296

concat_ws(separator, value1, value2...)
Finally, || (double pipe) can be used in  many databases to concatenate strings
(SQL Server uses + instead):
value1 || value2
TIP
If any of the values in a concatenation are null, the database will return null. Be sure to use
coalesce or CASE to replace null values with a default if you suspect they can occur.
Concatenation can bring together a field and a constant string. For example,
imagine we wanted to label the shapes as such and add the word “reports” to the
count of reports for each shape. The subquery parses the name of the shape from
the sighting_report field and counts the number of records. The outer
query concatenates the shapes with the string ' (shape)' and the reports
with the string ' reports':
SELECT concat(shape, ' (shape)') as shape
,concat(reports, ' reports') as reports
FROM
(
    SELECT split_part(
                 split_part(sighting_report,'Duration',1)
                 ,'Shape: ',2) as shape
    ,count(*) as reports
    FROM ufo
    GROUP BY 1
) a
;
Shape             reports
----------------  ------------
Changing (shape)  2295 reports
Chevron (shape)   1021 reports
Cigar (shape)     2119 reports
...               ...
We can also combine two fields together, optionally with a string separator. For
example, we could unite the shape and location values into a single field:

## Page 297

SELECT concat(shape,' - ',location) as shape_location
,reports
FROM
(
    SELECT 
    split_part(split_part(sighting_report,'Shape',1)
      ,'Location: ',2) as location
    ,split_part(split_part(sighting_report,'Duration',1)
       ,'Shape: ',2) as shape
    ,count(*) as reports
    FROM ufo
    GROUP BY 1,2
) a
;
shape_location           reports
-----------------------  -------
Light - Albuquerque, NM  58
Circle - Albany, OR      11
Fireball - Akron, OH     8
...                      ...
The top 10 combinations are graphed in Figure 5-10.

## Page 298

Figure 5-10. Top combinations of shape and location in UFO sightings
We saw earlier that “light” is the most common shape, so it’s not surprising that
it appears in each of the top results. Phoenix is the most common location, while
Las Vegas is the second most common overall.
In this case, since we went to so much trouble to parse out the different fields, it
might not make as much sense to concatenate them back together. However, it
can be useful to rearrange text or combine values into a single field for display in
another tool. By combining various fields and text, we can also generate
sentences that can function as summaries of the data, for use in emails or
automated reports. In this example, subquery a parses the occurred and
shape fields, as we’ve seen previously, and counts the records. Then in
subquery aa, the min and max of occurred are calculated, along with the
total number of reports, and the results are GROUPed BY shape. Rows with
occurred fields shorter than eight characters are excluded, to remove ones
that don’t have properly formed dates and avoid errors in the min and max

## Page 299

calculations. Finally, in the outer query, the final text is assembled with the
concat function. The format of the dates is changed to read as long dates
(April 9, 1957) for the earliest and latest dates:
SELECT 
concat('There were '
       ,reports
       ,' reports of '
       ,lower(shape)
       ,' objects. The earliest sighting was '
       ,trim(to_char(earliest,'Month'))
       , ' '
       , date_part('day',earliest)
       , ', '
       , date_part('year',earliest)
       ,' and the most recent was '
       ,trim(to_char(latest,'Month'))
       , ' '
       , date_part('day',latest)
       , ', '
       , date_part('year',latest)
       ,'.'
       )
FROM
(
    SELECT shape
    ,min(occurred::date) as earliest
    ,max(occurred::date) as latest
    ,sum(reports) as reports
    FROM
    (
        SELECT split_part(
                     split_part(
                           split_part(sighting_report,' (Entered',1)
                           ,'Occurred : ',2)
                     ,'Reported',1) as occurred
        ,split_part(
               split_part(sighting_report,'Duration',1)
               ,'Shape: ',2) as shape
        ,count(*) as reports
        FROM ufo
        GROUP BY 1,2
    ) a
    WHERE length(occurred) >= 8
    GROUP BY 1
) aa    
;

## Page 300

There were 820 reports of teardrop objects. The earliest sighting was 
April 9, 1957 and the most recent was October 3, 2020.
There were 7331 reports of fireball objects. The earliest sighting was
June 30, 1790 and the most recent was October 5, 2020.
There were 1020 reports of chevron objects. The earliest sighting was 
July 15, 1954 and the most recent was October 3, 2020.
We could get even more creative with formatting the number of reports or
adding coalesce or CASE statements to handle blank shape names, for
example. Although these sentences are repetitive and are therefore no match for
human (or AI) writers, they will be dynamic if the data source is frequently
updated and thus can be useful in reporting applications.
Along with functions and operators for creating new text with concatenation,
SQL has some special functions for reshaping text, which we’ll turn to next.
Reshaping Text
As we saw in Chapter 2, changing the shape of the data—either pivoting from
rows to columns or the reverse, changing the data from columns to rows—is
sometimes useful. We saw how to do that with GROUP BY and aggregations, or
with UNION statements. In SQL there are some special functions for reshaping
text, however.
One use case for reshaping text is when there are multiple rows with different
text values for an entity and we would like to combine them into a single value.
Combining values can make them more difficult to analyze, of course, but
sometimes the use case requires a single record per entity in the output.
Combining the individual values into a single field allows us to retain the detail.
The string_agg function takes two arguments, a field or an expression, and a
separator, which is commonly a comma but can be any separator character
desired. The function aggregates only values that are not null, and the order can
be controlled with an ORDER BY clause within the function as needed:
SELECT location
,string_agg(shape,', ' order by shape asc) as shapes
FROM
(
    SELECT

## Page 301

case when split_part(
                    split_part(sighting_report,'Duration',1)
                    ,'Shape: ',2) = '' then 'Unknown'
         when split_part(
                    split_part(sighting_report,'Duration',1)
                    ,'Shape: ',2) = 'TRIANGULAR' then 'Triangle'
         else split_part(
                    split_part(sighting_report,'Duration',1),'Shape: 
',2)  
         end as shape
    ,split_part(
            split_part(sighting_report,'Shape',1)
            ,'Location: ',2) as location
    ,count(*) as reports
    FROM ufo
    GROUP BY 1,2
) a
GROUP BY 1
;

Since string_agg is an aggregate function, it requires a GROUP BY clause
on the other fields in the query. In MySQL, an equivalent function is
group_concat, and analytic databases such as Redshift and Snowflake have a
similar function called listagg.
Another use case is to do just the opposite of string_agg and instead split out
a single field into multiple rows. There is a lot of inconsistency in how this is
implemented in different databases, and even whether a function exists for this at
all. Postgres has a function called regexp_split_to_table, while certain
other databases have a split_to_table function that operates similarly
(check documentation for availability and syntax in your database). The
regexp_split_to_table function takes two arguments, a string value and
a delimiter. The delimiter can be a regular expression, but keep in mind that a
regex can also be a simple string such as a comma or space character. The
function then splits the values into rows:

## Page 302

SELECT 
regexp_split_to_table('Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple'
                      ,', '); 
regexp_split_to_table
---------------------
Red
Orange
Yellow
Green
Blue
Purple
The string to be split can include anything and doesn’t necessarily need to be a
list. We can use the function to split up any string, including sentences. We can
then use this to find the most common words used in text fields, a potentially
useful tool for text analysis work. Let’s take a look at the most common words
used in UFO sighting report descriptions:
SELECT word, count(*) as frequency
FROM
(
    SELECT regexp_split_to_table(lower(description),'\s+') as word
    FROM ufo
) a
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
word  frequency
----  ---------
the   882810
and   477287
a     450223
The subquery first transforms the description into lowercase, since case
variations are not interesting for this example. Next, the string is split using the
regex '\s+', which splits on any one or more whitespace characters.
The most commonly used words are not surprising; however, they are not
particularly useful since they are just commonly used words in general. To find a
more meaningful list, we can remove what are called stop words. These are
simply the most commonly used words in a language. Some databases have
built-in lists in what are called dictionaries, but the implementations are not

## Page 303

standard. There is also no single agreed-upon correct list of stop words, and it is
common to adjust the particular list for the desired application; however, there
are a number of lists of common stop words on the internet. For this example, I
loaded a list of 421 common words into a table called stop_words, available
on the book’s GitHub site. The stop words are removed from the result set with a
LEFT JOIN to the stop_words table, filtered to results that are not in that
table:
SELECT word, count(*) as frequency
FROM
(
    SELECT regexp_split_to_table(lower(description),'\s+') as word
    FROM ufo
) a
LEFT JOIN stop_words b on a.word = b.stop_word
WHERE b.stop_word is null
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
word    frequency
------  ---------
light   97071
lights  89537
object  80785
...     ...
The top 10 most common words are graphed in Figure 5-11.

## Page 304

Figure 5-11. Most common words in UFO sighting descriptions, excluding stop words
We could continue to get more sophisticated by adding additional common
words to the stop_words table or by JOINing the results with the descriptions
to tag them with the interesting words they contain. Note that
regexp_split_to_table and similar functions in other databases can be
slow, depending on the length and number of records analyzed.
Constructing and reshaping text with SQL can be done in as simple or complex a
way or ways as needed. Concatenation, string aggregation, and string-splitting
functions can be used alone, in combination with each other, and with other SQL
functions and operators to achieve the desired data output.
Conclusion
Although SQL isn’t always the first tool mentioned when it comes to text
analysis, it has many powerful functions and operators for accomplishing a
variety of tasks. From parsing and transformations, to finding and replacing, to

## Page 305

constructing and reshaping text, SQL can be used to both clean and prepare text
data as well as perform analysis.
In the next chapter, we’ll turn to using SQL for anomaly detection, another topic
in which SQL isn’t always the first tool mentioned but for which it has surprising
capabilities.
1  Since the data set was created in the United States, it is in mm/dd/yyyy format. Many other parts of
the world use the dd/mm/yyyy format instead. It’s always worth checking your source and adjusting
your code as needed.

## Page 306

Chapter 6. Anomaly Detection
An anomaly is something that is different from other members of the same
group. In data, an anomaly is a record, an observation, or a value that differs
from the remaining data points in a way that raises concerns or suspicions.
Anomalies go by a number of different names, including outliers, novelties,
noise, deviations, and exceptions, to name a few. I’ll use the terms anomaly and
outlier interchangeably throughout this chapter, and you may see the other terms
used in discussions of this topic as well. Anomaly detection can be the end goal
of an analysis or a step within a broader analysis project.
Anomalies typically have one of two sources: real events that are extreme or
otherwise unusual, or errors introduced during data collection or processing.
While many of the steps used to detect outliers are the same regardless of the
source, how we choose to handle a particular anomaly depends on the root
cause. As a result, understanding the root cause and distinguishing between the
two types of causes is important to the analysis process.
Real events can generate outliers for a variety of reasons. Anomalous data can
signal fraud, network intrusion, structural defects in a product, loopholes in
policies, or product use that wasn’t intended or envisioned by the developers.
Anomaly detection is widely used to root out financial fraud, and cybersecurity
also makes use of this type of analysis. Sometimes anomalous data results not
because a bad actor is trying to exploit a system but because a customer is using
a product in an unexpected way. For example, I knew someone who used a
fitness-tracking app, which was intended for running, cycling, walking, and
similar activities, to record data from his outings at the auto race track. He hadn’t
found a better option and wasn’t thinking about how anomalous the speed and
distance values for a car on a track are compared to those recorded for bike rides
or running. When anomalies can be tracked to a real process, deciding what to
do with them requires a good understanding of the analysis to be done, as well as
domain knowledge, terms of use, and sometimes the legal system that governs
the product.
Data can also contain anomalies because of errors in collection or processing.

## Page 307

Manually entered data is notorious for typos and incorrect data. Changes to
forms, fields, or validation rules can introduce unexpected values, including
nulls. Behavior tracking of web and mobile applications is common; however,
any change to how and when this logging is done can introduce anomalies. I’ve
spent enough hours diagnosing changes in metrics that I’ve learned to ask up
front whether any logging was recently changed. Data processing can introduce
outliers when some values are filtered erroneously, processing steps fail to
complete, or data is loaded multiple times, creating duplicates. When anomalies
result from data processing, we can generally be more confident in correcting or
discarding those values. Of course, fixing the upstream data entry or processing
is always a good idea, if possible, to prevent future quality problems.
In this chapter, I’ll first discuss some of the reasons to use SQL for this type of
analysis and places in which it falls short. Then I’ll introduce the earthquakes
data set that will be used in the examples in the rest of the chapter. After that, I’ll
introduce the basic tools that we have at our disposal in SQL for detecting
outliers. Then I’ll discuss the various forms of outliers that we can apply the
tools to find. Once we’ve detected and understood anomalies, the next step is to
decide what to do with them. Anomalies need not always be problematic, as they
are in fraud detection, cyberattack detection, and health system monitoring. The
techniques in this chapter can also be used to detect unusually good customers or
marketing campaigns, or positive shifts in customer behavior. Sometimes the
goal of anomaly detection is to pass the anomalies on to other humans or
machines to deal with, but often this is a step in a wider analysis, so I’ll wrap up
with various options for correcting anomalies.
Capabilities and Limits of SQL for Anomaly
Detection
SQL is a versatile and powerful language for many data analysis tasks, though it
can’t do everything. When performing anomaly detection, SQL has a number of
strengths, as well as some drawbacks that make other languages or tools better
choices for some tasks.
SQL is worth considering when the data set is already in a database, as we
previously saw with time series and text analysis in Chapters 3 and 5,

## Page 308

respectively. SQL leverages the computational power of the database to perform
calculations over many records quickly. Particularly with large tables of data,
transferring out of a database and into another tool is time consuming. Working
within a database makes even more sense when anomaly detection is a step in a
larger analysis that will be done in SQL. Code written in SQL can be examined
to understand why particular records were flagged as outliers, and SQL will
remain consistent over time even as the data flowing into a database changes.
On the negative side, SQL does not have the statistical sophistication that is
available in packages developed for languages like R and Python. SQL has
several standard statistical functions, but additional, more complex statistical
calculations may be too slow or intense for some databases. For use cases
requiring very rapid response, such as fraud or intrusion detection, analyzing
data in a database may simply not be appropriate, since there is often lag in
loading data, particularly to analytics databases. A common workflow is to use
SQL to do the initial analysis and determine typical minimum, maximum, and
average values and then develop more real-time monitoring using a streaming
service or special real-time data stores. Detecting types of outlier patterns and
then implementing in streaming services or special real-time data stores can be
an option, however. Finally, SQL code is rule based, as we saw in Chapter 5. It is
very good for handling a known set of conditions or criteria, but SQL will not
automatically adjust for the types of changing patterns seen with rapidly
changing adversaries. Machine learning approaches, and the languages
associated with them, are often a better choice for these applications.
Now that we’ve discussed the advantages of SQL and when to use it instead of
another language or tool, let’s take a look at the data we’ll be using for examples
in this chapter before moving on to the code itself.
The Data Set
The data for the examples in this chapter is a set of records for all earthquakes
recorded by the US Geological Survey (USGS) from 2010 to 2020. The USGS
provides the data in a number of formats, including real-time feeds, at
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed.
The data set contains approximately 1.5 million records. Each record represents

## Page 309

a single earthquake event and includes information such as the timestamp,
location, magnitude, depth, and source of the information. A sample of the data
is shown in Figure 6-1. A full data dictionary is available on the USGS site.
Figure 6-1. Sample of the earthquakes data
Earthquakes are caused by sudden slips along faults in the tectonic plates that
exist on the outer surface of the earth. Locations on the edges of these plates
experience many more, and more dramatic, earthquakes than other places. The
so-called Ring of Fire is a region along the rim of the Pacific Ocean in which
many earthquakes occur. Various locations within this region, including
California, Alaska, Japan, and Indonesia, will appear frequently in our analysis.
Magnitude is a measure of the size of an earthquake at its source, as measured by
its seismic waves. Magnitude is recorded on a logarithmic scale, meaning that
the amplitude of a magnitude 5 earthquake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4
earthquake. The actual measurement of earthquakes is fascinating but beyond
the scope of this book. The USGS website is a good place to start if you want to

## Page 310

learn more.
Detecting Outliers
Although the idea of an anomaly or outlier—a data point that is very different
from the rest—seems straightforward, actually finding one in any particular data
set poses some challenges. The first challenge has to do with knowing when a
value or data point is common or rare, and the second is setting a threshold for
marking values on either side of this dividing line. As we go through the
earthquakes data, we’ll profile the depths and magnitudes in order to
develop an understanding of which values are normal and which are unusual.
Generally, the larger or more complete the data set, the easier it is to make a
judgment on what is truly anomalous. In some instances, we have labeled or
“ground truth” values to which we can refer. A label is generally a column in the
data set that indicates whether the record is normal or an outlier. Ground truth
can be obtained from industry or scientific sources or from past analysis and
might tell us, for example, that any earthquake greater than magnitude 7 is an
anomaly. In other cases, we must look to the data itself and apply reasonable
judgment. For the remainder of the chapter, we’ll assume that we have a large
enough data set to do just that, though of course there are outside references we
could consult on typical and extreme earthquake magnitudes.
Our tools for detecting outliers using the data set itself fall into a few categories.
First, we can sort or ORDER BY the values in the data. This can optionally be
combined with various GROUP BY clauses to find outliers by frequency.
Second, we can use SQL’s statistical functions to find extreme values at either
end of a value range. Finally, we can graph data and inspect it visually.
Sorting to Find Anomalies
One of the basic tools we have for finding outliers is sorting the data,
accomplished with the ORDER BY clause. The default behavior of ORDER BY is
to sort ascending (ASC). To sort in descending order, add DESC after the
column. An ORDER BY clause can include one or more columns, and each
column can be sorted ascending or descending, independently of the others.
Sorting starts with the first column specified. If a second column is specified, the

## Page 311

results of the first sort are then sorted by the second column (retaining the first
sort), and so on through all the columns in the clause.
TIP
Since ordering happens after the database has calculated the rest of the query, many databases
allow you to reference the query columns by number instead of by name. SQL Server is an
exception; it requires the full name. I prefer the numbering syntax because it results in more
compact code, particularly when query columns include lengthy calculations or function
syntax.
For example, we can sort the earthquakes table by mag, the magnitude:
SELECT mag
FROM earthquakes
ORDER BY 1 desc
;
mag
------
(null)
(null)
(null)
...
This returns a number of rows of nulls. Let’s make a note that the data set can
contain null values for magnitude—a possible outlier in itself. We can exclude
the null values:
SELECT mag
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag is not null
ORDER BY 1 desc
;
mag
---
9.1
8.8
8.6
8.3

## Page 312

There is only one value greater than 9, and there are only two additional values
greater than 8.5. In many contexts, these would not appear to be particularly
large values. However, with a little domain knowledge about earthquakes, we
can recognize that these values are in fact both very large and unusual. The
USGS provides a list of the 20 largest earthquakes in the world. All of them are
magnitude 8.4 or larger, while only five are magnitude 9.0 or larger, and three
occurred between 2010 and 2020, the time period covered by our data set.
Another way to consider whether values are anomalies within a data set is to
calculate their frequency. We can count the id field and GROUP BY the mag
to find the number of earthquakes per magnitude. The number of earthquakes
per magnitude is then divided by the total number of earthquakes, which can be
found using a sum window function. All window functions require an OVER
clause with a PARTITION BY and/or ORDER BY clause. Since the denominator
should count all the records, I have added a PARTITION BY 1, which is a way to
force the database to make it a window function but still read from the entire
table. Finally, the result set is ORDERed BY the magnitude:
SELECT mag
,count(id) as earthquakes
,round(count(id) * 100.0 / sum(count(id)) over (partition by 1),8) 
 as pct_earthquakes
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag is not null
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 desc
;
mag  earthquakes  pct_earthquakes
---  -----------  ---------------
9.1  1            0.00006719
8.8  1            0.00006719
8.6  1            0.00006719
8.3  2            0.00013439
...  ...          ... 
6.9  53           0.00356124
6.8  45           0.00302370
6.7  60           0.00403160
...  ...          ...
There is only one each of the earthquakes that are over 8.5 in magnitude, but
there are two that registered 8.3. By the value 6.9, there are double digits of

## Page 313

earthquakes, but those still represent a very small percentage of the data. In our
investigation, we should also check the other end of the sorting, the smallest
values, by sorting ascending instead of descending:
SELECT mag
,count(id) as earthquakes
,round(count(id) * 100.0 / sum(count(id)) over (partition by 1),8) 
 as pct_earthquakes
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag is not null
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
;
mag   earthquakes  pct_earthquakes
---    -----------  ---------------
-9.99  258          0.01733587
-9     29           0.00194861
-5     1            0.00006719
-2.6   2            0.00013439
...    ...          ...
At the low end of values, –9.99 and –9 occur more frequently than we might
expect. Although we can’t take the logarithm of zero or a negative number, a
logarithm can be negative when the argument is greater than zero and less than
one. For example, log(0.5) is equal to approximately –0.301. The values –9.99
and –9 represent extremely small earthquake magnitudes, and we might question
whether such small quakes could really be detected. Given the frequency of
these values, I suspect they represent an unknown value rather than a truly tiny
earthquake, and thus we may consider them anomalies.
In addition to sorting the overall data, it can be useful to GROUP BY one or
more attribute fields to find anomalies within subsets of the data. For example,
we might want to check the highest and lowest magnitudes recorded for specific
geographies in the place field:
SELECT place, mag, count(*)
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag is not null
 and place = 'Northern California'
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2 desc
;

## Page 314

place                mag   count
-------------------  ----  -----
Northern California  5.61
Northern California  4.73  1
Northern California  4.51  1
...                  ...   ...
Northern California  -1.1  7
Northern California  -1.2  2
Northern California  -1.6  1
“Northern California” is the most common place in the data set, and inspecting
just the subset for it, we can see that the high and low values are not nearly as
extreme as those for the data set as a whole. Earthquakes over 5.0 magnitude are
not uncommon overall, but they are outliers for “Northern California.”
Calculating Percentiles and Standard Deviations to Find
Anomalies
Sorting and optionally grouping data and then reviewing the results visually is a
useful approach for spotting anomalies, particularly when the data has values
that are very extreme. Without domain knowledge, however, it might not be
obvious that a 9.0 magnitude earthquake is such an anomaly. Quantifying the
extremity of data points adds another layer of rigor to the analysis. There are two
ways to do this: with percentiles or with standard deviations.
Percentiles represent the proportion of values in a distribution that are less than a
particular value. The median of a distribution is the value at which half of the
population has a lower value and half has a higher value. The median is so
commonly used that it has its own SQL function, median, in many but not all
databases. Other percentiles can be calculated as well. For example, we can find
the 25th percentile, where 25% of the values are lower and 75% are higher, or
the 89th percentile, where 89% of values are lower and 11% are higher.
Percentiles are often found in academic contexts, such as standardized testing,
but they can be applied to any domain.
SQL has a window function, percent_rank, that returns the percentile for
each row within a partition. As with all window functions, the sorting direction
is controlled with an ORDER BY statement. Similar to the rank function,
percent_rank does not take any argument; it operates over all the rows

## Page 315

returned by the query. The basic form is:
percent_rank() over (partition by ... order by ...)
Both the PARTITION BY and the ORDER BY are optional, but the function
requires something in the OVER clause, and specifying the ordering is always a
good idea. To find the percentile of the magnitudes of each earthquake for each
place, we can first calculate the percent_rank for each row in the subquery
and then count the occurrences of each magnitude in the outer query. Note that
it’s important to calculate the percent_rank first, before doing any
aggregation, so that repeating values are taken into account in the calculation:
SELECT place, mag, percentile
,count(*)
FROM
(
    SELECT place, mag
    ,percent_rank() over (partition by place order by mag) as 
percentile
    FROM earthquakes
    WHERE mag is not null
    and place = 'Northern California'
) a
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 1,2 desc
;
place                mag   percentile             count
-------------------  ----  ---------------------  -----  
Northern California  5.6   1.0                    1
Northern California  4.73  0.9999870597065141     1
Northern California  4.51  0.9999741194130283     1
...                  ...   ...                    ...
Northern California  -1.1  3.8820880457568775E-5  7
Northern California  -1.2  1.2940293485856258E-5  2
Northern California  -1.6  0.0                    1
Within Northern California, the magnitude 5.6 earthquake has a percentile of 1,
or 100%, indicating that all of the other values are less than this one. The
magnitude –1.6 earthquake has a percentile of 0, indicating that no other data
points are smaller.
In addition to finding the exact percentile of each row, SQL can carve the data

## Page 316

set into a specified number of buckets and return the bucket each row belongs to
with a function called ntile. For example, we might want to carve the data set
up into 100 buckets:
SELECT place, mag
,ntile(100) over (partition by place order by mag) as ntile
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag is not null
and place = 'Central Alaska'
ORDER BY 1,2 desc
;
place           mag  ntile
--------------  ----  -----  
Central Alaska  5.4   100
Central Alaska  5.3   100
Central Alaska  5.2   100
...             ...   ...  
Central Alaska  1.5   79
...             ...   ...    
Central Alaska  -0.5  1
Central Alaska  -0.5  1
Central Alaska  -0.5  1
Looking at the results for “Central Alaska,” we see that the three earthquakes
greater than 5 are in the 100th percentile, 1.5 falls within the 79th percentile, and
the smallest values of –0.5 fall in the first percentile. After calculating these
values, we can then find the boundaries of each ntile, using max and min. For
this example, we’ll use four ntiles to keep the display simpler, but any positive
integer is allowed in the ntile argument:
SELECT place, ntile
,max(mag) as maximum
,min(mag) as minimum
FROM
(
    SELECT place, mag
    ,ntile(4) over (partition by place order by mag) as ntile
    FROM earthquakes
    WHERE mag is not null
    and place = 'Central Alaska'
) a
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2 desc
;

## Page 317

place           ntile  maximum  minimum
--------------  -----  -------  -------
Central Alaska  4      5.4      1.4
Central Alaska  3      1.4      1.1
Central Alaska  2      1.1      0.8
Central Alaska  1      0.8      -0.5
The highest ntile, 4, which represents the 75th to 100th percentiles, has the
widest range, spanning from 1.4 to 5.4. On the other hand, the middle 50 percent
of values, which include ntiles 2 and 3, range only from 0.8 to 1.4.
In addition to finding the percentile or ntile for each row, we can calculate
specific percentiles across the entire result set of a query. To do this, we can use
the percentile_cont function or the percentile_disc function. Both
are window functions, but with a slightly different syntax than other window
functions discussed previously because they require a WITHIN GROUP clause.
The form of the functions is:
percentile_cont(numeric) within group (order by field_name) over 
(partition by
field_name)
The numeric is a value between 0 and 1 that represents the percentile to return.
For example, 0.25 returns the 25th percentile. The ORDER BY clause specifies
the field to return the percentile from, as well as the ordering. ASC or DESC can
optionally be added, with ASC the default, as in all ORDER BY clauses in SQL.
The OVER (PARTITION BY...) clause is optional (and confusingly, some
databases don’t support it, so check your documentation if you run into errors).
The percentile_cont function will return an interpolated (calculated) value
that corresponds to the exact percentile but that may not exist in the data set. The
percentile_disc (discontinuous percentile) function, on the other hand,
returns the value in the data set that is closest to the requested percentile. For
large data sets, or for ones with fairly continuous values, there is often little
practical difference between the output of the two functions, but it’s worth
considering which is more appropriate for your analysis. Let’s take a look at an
example to see how this looks in practice. We’ll calculate the 25th, 50th (or
median), and 75th percentile magnitudes for all nonnull magnitudes in Central

## Page 318

Alaska:
SELECT 
percentile_cont(0.25) within group (order by mag) as pct_25
,percentile_cont(0.5) within group (order by mag) as pct_50
,percentile_cont(0.75) within group (order by mag) as pct_75
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag is not null
and place = 'Central Alaska'
;
pct_25  pct_50  pct_75
------  ------  ------
0.8     1.1     1.4
The query returns the requested percentiles, summarized across the data set.
Notice that the values correspond to the maximum values for ntiles 1, 2, and 3
calculated in the previous example. Percentiles for different fields can be
calculated within the same query by changing the field in the ORDER BY clause:
SELECT 
percentile_cont(0.25) within group (order by mag) as pct_25_mag
,percentile_cont(0.25) within group (order by depth) as pct_25_depth
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag is not null
and place = 'Central Alaska'
;
pct_25_mag  pct_25_depth
----------  ------------
0.8         7.1
Unlike other window functions, percentile_cont and
percentile_disc require a GROUP BY clause at the query level when other
fields are present in the query. For example, if we want to consider two areas
within Alaska, and so include the place field, the query must also include it in
the GROUP BY, and the percentiles are calculated per place:
SELECT place
,percentile_cont(0.25) within group (order by mag) as pct_25_mag
,percentile_cont(0.25) within group (order by depth) as pct_25_depth
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag is not null

## Page 319

and place in ('Central Alaska', 'Southern Alaska')
GROUP BY place
;
place            pct_25_mag  pct_25_depth
---------------  ----------  ------------
Central Alaska   0.8         7.1
Southern Alaska  1.2         10.1
With these functions, we can find any percentile required for analysis. Since the
median value is so commonly calculated, a number of databases have
implemented a median function that has only one argument, the field for which
to calculate the median. This is a handy and certainly much simpler syntax, but
note that the same can be accomplished with percentile_cont if a
median function is not available.
TIP
The percentile and median functions can be slow and computationally intensive on large
data sets. This is because the database must sort and rank all the records, usually in memory.
Some database vendors have implemented approximate versions of the functions, such as
approximate_percentile, that are much faster and return results very close to the
function that calculates the entire data set.
Finding the percentiles or ntiles of a data set allows us to add some
quantification to anomalies. We’ll see later in the chapter how these values also
give us some tools for handling anomalies in data sets. Since percentiles are
always scaled between 0 and 100, however, they don’t give a sense of just how
unusual certain values are. For that we can turn to additional statistical functions
supported by SQL.
To measure how extreme values in a data set are, we can use the standard
deviation. The standard deviation is a measure of the variation in a set of values.
A lower value means less variation, while a higher number means more
variation. When data is normally distributed around the mean, about 68% of the
values lie within +/– one standard deviation from the mean, and about 95% lie
within two standard deviations. The standard deviation is calculated as the
square root of the sum of differences from the mean, divided by the number of
observations:

## Page 320

In this formula, x  is an observation, μ is the average of all the observations, ∑
indicates that all of the values should be summed, and N is the number of
observations. Refer to any good statistics text or online resource  for more
information about how the standard deviation is derived.
Most databases have three standard deviation functions. The stddev_pop
function finds the standard deviation of a population. If the data set represents
the entire population, as is often the case with a customer data set, use the
stddev_pop. The stddev_samp finds the standard deviation of a sample
and differs from the above formula by dividing by N – 1 instead of N. This has
the effect of increasing the standard deviation, reflecting the loss of accuracy
when only a sample of the entire population is used. The stddev function
available in many databases is identical to the stddev_samp function and may
be used simply because it is shorter. If you’re working with data that is a sample,
such as from a survey or study from a larger population, use the stddev_samp
or stddev. In practice, when you are working with large data sets, there is
usually little difference between the stddev_pop and stddev_samp results.
For example, across the 1.5 million records in the earthquakes table, the
values diverge only after five decimal places:
SELECT stddev_pop(mag) as stddev_pop_mag
,stddev_samp(mag) as stddev_samp_mag
FROM earthquakes
;
stddev_pop_mag        stddev_samp_mag
--------------------  --------------------
1.273605805569390395  1.273606233458381515
These differences are small enough that in most practical applications, it doesn’t
matter which standard deviation function you use.
With this function, we can now calculate the number of standard deviations from
the mean for each value in the data set. This value is known as the z-score and is
a way of standardizing data. Values that are above the average have a positive z-
score, and those below the average have a negative z-score. Figure 6-2 shows
i

## Page 321

how z-scores and standard deviations relate to the normal distribution.

## Page 323

Figure 6-2. Standard deviations and z-scores for a normal distribution
To find the z-scores for the earthquakes, first calculate the average and standard
deviation for the entire data set in a subquery. Then JOIN this back to the data
set using a Cartesian JOIN, so that the average and standard deviation values are
JOINed to each earthquake row. This is accomplished with the 1 = 1 syntax,
since most databases require that some JOIN condition be specified.
In the outer query, subtract the average magnitude from each individual
magnitude and then divide by the standard deviation:
SELECT a.place, a.mag
,b.avg_mag, b.std_dev
,(a.mag - b.avg_mag) / b.std_dev as z_score
FROM earthquakes a
JOIN
(
    SELECT avg(mag) as avg_mag
    ,stddev_pop(mag) as std_dev
    FROM earthquakes
    WHERE mag is not null
) b on 1 = 1
WHERE a.mag is not null
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
place                                   mag  avg_mag  std_dev  z_score

The largest earthquakes have a z-score of almost 6, whereas the smallest
(excluding the –9 and –9.99 earthquakes that appear to be data entry anomalies)
have z-scores close to 3. We can conclude that the largest earthquakes are more
extreme outliers than the ones at the low end.
Graphing to Find Anomalies Visually

## Page 324

In addition to sorting the data and calculating percentiles and standard deviations
to find anomalies, visualizing the data in one of several graph formats can also
help in finding anomalies. As we’ve seen in previous chapters, one strength of
graphs is their ability to summarize and present many data points in a compact
form. By inspecting graphs, we can often spot patterns and outliers that we
might otherwise miss if only considering the raw output. Finally, graphs assist in
the task of describing the data, and any potential problems with the data related
to anomalies, to other people.
In this section, I’ll present three types of graphs that are useful for anomaly
detection: bar graphs, scatter plots, and box plots. The SQL needed to generate
output for these graphs is straightforward, though you might need to enlist
pivoting strategies discussed in previous chapters, depending on the capabilities
and limitations of the software used to create the graphs. Any major BI tool or
spreadsheet software, or languages such as Python or R, will be able to produce
these graph types. The graphs in this section were created using Python with
Matplotlib.
The bar graph is used to plot a histogram or distribution of the values in a field
and is useful for both characterizing the data and spotting outliers. The full
extent of values are plotted along one axis, and the number of occurrences of
each value is plotted on the other axis. The extreme high and low values are
interesting, as is the shape of the plot. We can quickly determine whether the
distribution is approximately normal (symmetric around a peak or average
value), has another type of distribution, or has peaks at particular values.
To graph a histogram for the earthquake magnitudes, first create a data set that
groups the magnitudes and counts the earthquakes. Then plot the output, as in
Figure 6-3.
SELECT mag
,count(*) as earthquakes
FROM earthquakes
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
;
mag    earthquakes
-----  -----------
-9.99  258

## Page 325

-9     29
-5     1
...    ...
Figure 6-3. Distribution of earthquake magnitudes
The graph extends from –10.0 to +10.0, which makes sense given our previous
exploration of the data. It peaks and is roughly symmetric around a value in the
range of 1.1 to 1.4 with almost 40,000 earthquakes of each magnitude, but it has
a second peak of almost 20,000 earthquakes around the value 4.4. We’ll explore
the reason for this second peak in the next section on forms of anomalies. The
extreme values are hard to spot in this graph, however, so we might want to
zoom in on a subsection of the graph, as in Figure 6-4.

## Page 326

Figure 6-4. A zoomed-in view of the distribution of earthquake magnitudes, focused on the highest
magnitudes
Here the frequencies of these very high-intensity earthquakes are easier to see, as
is the decrease in frequency from more than 10 to only 1 as the value goes from
the low 7s to over 8. Thankfully these temblors are extremely rare.
A second type of graph that can be used to characterize data and spot outliers is
the scatter plot. A scatter plot is appropriate when the data set contains at least
two numeric values of interest. The x-axis displays the range of values of the
first data field, the y-axis displays the range of values of the second data field,
and a dot is graphed for every pair of x and y values in the data set. For example,
we can graph the magnitude against the depth of earthquakes in the data set.
First, query the data to create a data set of each pair of values. Then graph the
output, as in Figure 6-5:
SELECT mag, depth
,count(*) as earthquakes
FROM earthquakes
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
;

## Page 327

mag    depth  earthquakes
-----  -----  -----------
-9.99  -0.59  1
-9.99  -0.35  1
-9.99  -0.11  1
...    ...    ...

## Page 328

Figure 6-5. Scatter plot of the magnitude and depth of earthquakes
In this graph, we can see the same range of magnitudes, now plotted against the
depths, which range from just below zero to around 700 kilometers.
Interestingly, the high depth values, over 300, correspond to magnitudes that are

## Page 329

roughly 4 and higher. Perhaps such deep earthquakes can be detected only after
they reach a minimum magnitude. Note that, due to the volume of data, I have
taken a shortcut and grouped the values by magnitude and depth combination,
rather than plotting all 1.5 million data points. The count of earthquakes can be
used to size each circle in the scatter, as in Figure 6-6, which is zoomed in to the
range of magnitudes from 4.0 to 7.0, and depths from 0 to 50 km.

## Page 331

Figure 6-6. Scatter plot of the magnitude and depth of earthquakes, zoomed in and with circles sized by the
number of earthquakes
A third type of graph useful in finding and analyzing outliers is the box plot, also
known as the box-and-whisker plot. These graphs summarize data in the middle
of the range of values while retaining the outliers. The graph type is named for
the box, or rectangle, in the middle. The line that forms the bottom of the
rectangle is located at the 25th percentile value, the line that forms the top is
located at the 75th percentile, and the line through the middle is located at the
50th percentile, or median, value. Percentiles should be familiar from our
discussion in the preceding section. The “whiskers” of the box plot are lines that
extend out from the box, typically to 1.5 times the interquartile range. The
interquartile range is simply the difference between the 75th percentile value and
the 25th percentile value. Any values beyond the whiskers are plotted on the
graph as outliers.
TIP
Whichever software or programming language you use for graphing box plots will take care of
the calculations of the percentiles and interquartile range. Many also offer options to plot the
whiskers based on standard deviations from the mean, or on wider percentiles such as the 10th
and 90th. The calculation will always be symmetric around the midpoint (such as one standard
deviation above and below the mean), but the length of the upper and lower whiskers can
differ based on the data.
Typically, all of the values are plotted in a box plot. Since the data set is so large,
for this example we’ll look at the subset of 16,036 earthquakes that include
“Japan” in the place field. First, create the data set with SQL, which is a
simple SELECT of all of the mag values that meet the filter criteria:
SELECT mag
FROM earthquakes
WHERE place like '%Japan%'
ORDER BY 1
;
mag
---
2.7
3.1

## Page 332

3.2
...
Then create a box plot in our graphing software of choice, as shown in Figure 6-
7.

## Page 334

Figure 6-7. Box plot showing magnitude distribution of earthquakes in Japan
Although the graphing software will often provide this information, we can also
find the key values for the box plot with SQL:
SELECT ntile_25, median, ntile_75
,(ntile_75 - ntile_25) * 1.5 as iqr
,ntile_25 - (ntile_75 - ntile_25) * 1.5 as lower_whisker
,ntile_75 + (ntile_75 - ntile_25) * 1.5 as upper_whisker
FROM
(
    SELECT 
    percentile_cont(0.25) within group (order by mag) as ntile_25
    ,percentile_cont(0.5) within group (order by mag) as median
    ,percentile_cont(0.75) within group (order by mag) as ntile_75
    FROM earthquakes
    WHERE place like '%Japan%'
) a
;
ntile_25  median  ntile_75  iqr  lower_whisker   upper_whisker
--------  ------  --------  ----  -------------  -------------
4.3       4.5     4.7       0.60  3.70           5.30
The median Japanese earthquake had a magnitude of 4.5, and the whiskers
extend from 3.7 to 5.3. The plotted circles represent outlier earthquakes, both
small and large. The Great Tohoku Earthquake of 2011, at 9.1, is an obvious
outlier, even among the larger earthquakes Japan experienced.
WARNING
In my experience, box plots are one of the more difficult visualizations to explain to those who
don’t have a statistics background, or who don’t spend all day making and looking at
visualizations. The interquartile range is a particularly confusing concept, though the notion of
outliers seems to make sense to most people. If you’re not absolutely sure your audience
knows how to interpret a box plot, take the time to explain it in clear but not overly technical
terms. I keep a drawing like Figure 6-8 that explains the parts of a box plot and send it along
with my work “just in case” my audience needs a refresher.

## Page 335

Figure 6-8. Diagram of parts of a box plot

## Page 336

Box plots can also be used to compare across groupings of the data to further
identify and diagnose where outliers occur. For example, we can compare
earthquakes in Japan in different years. First add the year of the time field into
the SQL output and then graph, as in Figure 6-9:
SELECT date_part('year',time)::int as year
,mag
FROM earthquakes
WHERE place like '%Japan%'
ORDER BY 1,2
;
 
year  mag
----  ---
2010  3.6
2010  3.7
2010  3.7
...   ...

## Page 338

Figure 6-9. Box plot of magnitudes of earthquakes in Japan, by year
Although the median and the range of the boxes fluctuate a bit from year to year,
they are consistently between 4 and 5. Japan experienced large outlier
earthquakes every year, with at least one greater than 6.0, and in six of the years
it experienced at least one earthquake at or larger than 7.0. Japan is undoubtedly
a very seismically active region.
Bar graphs, scatter plots, and box plots are commonly used to detect and
characterize outliers in data sets. They allow us to quickly absorb the complexity
of large amounts of data and to start to tell the story behind it. Along with
sorting, percentiles, and standard deviations, graphs are an important part of the
anomaly detection toolkit. With these tools in hand, we’re ready to discuss the
various forms that anomalies can take in addition to those we’ve seen so far.
Forms of Anomalies
Anomalies can come in all shapes and sizes. In this section, I will discuss three
general categories of anomalies: values, counts or frequencies, and presence or
absence. These are starting points for investigating any data set, either as a
profiling exercise or because anomalies are suspected. Outliers and other
unusual values are often specific to a particular domain, so in general the more
you know about how and why the data was generated, the better. However, these
patterns and techniques for spotting anomalies are good starting places for
investigation.
Anomalous Values
Perhaps the most common type of anomaly, and the first thing that comes to
mind on this topic, is when single values are either extremely high or low
outliers, or when values in the middle of the distribution are otherwise unusual.
In the last section, we looked at several ways to find outliers, through sorting,
percentiles and standard deviations, and graphing. We discovered that the
earthquakes data set has both unusually large values for the magnitude and some
values that appear to be unusually small. The magnitudes also contain varying
numbers of significant digits, or digits to the right of the decimal point. For

## Page 339

example, we can look at a subset of values around 1 and find a pattern that
repeats throughout the data set:
SELECT mag, count(*)
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag > 1
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
limit 100
;
mag         count

....        ...
Every once in a while there is a value with 8 significant digits. Many values have
two significant digits, but having only a single significant digit is more common.
This is likely due to different levels of precision in the instruments collecting the
magnitude data. Additionally, the database does not display a second significant
digit when that digit is zero, so “1.10” appears simply as “1.1.” However, the
large number of records at “1.1” indicates that this is not just a display issue.
Depending on the purpose of the analysis, we may or may not want to adjust the
values to all have the same number of significant digits by rounding.
Often in addition to finding anomalous values, understanding why they
happened or other attributes that are correlated with anomalies is useful. This is
where creativity and data detective work come into play. For example, 1,215
records in the data set have very high depth values of more than 600 kilometers.
We might want to know where these outliers occurred or how they were
collected. Let’s take a look at the source, which we can find in the net (for
network) field:
SELECT net, count(*)
FROM earthquakes
WHERE depth > 600

## Page 340

GROUP BY 1
;
net  count
---  -----
us   1215
The USGS site indicates that this source is the USGS National Earthquake
Information Center, PDE. This is not terribly informative, however, so let’s
check the place values, which contain the earthquake locations:
SELECT place, count(*)
FROM earthquakes
WHERE depth > 600
GROUP BY 1
;
place                           count
------------------------------  -----
100km NW of Ndoi Island, Fiji   1
100km SSW of Ndoi Island, Fiji  1
100km SW of Ndoi Island, Fiji   1
...                             ...
Visual inspection suggests that many of these very deep earthquakes happen
around Ndoi Island in Fiji. However, the place includes a distance and direction
component, such as “100km NW of,” that makes summarization more difficult.
We can apply some text parsing to focus on the place itself for better insights.
For places that contain some values and then “ of ” and some more values, split
on the “ of ” string and take the second part:
SELECT 
case when place like '% of %' then split_part(place,' of ',2) 
     else place end as place_name
,count(*)
FROM earthquakes
WHERE depth > 600
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
place_name         count
-----------------  -----
Ndoi Island, Fiji  487

## Page 341

Fiji region        186
Lambasa, Fiji      140
...                ...
We can now say with more confidence that the majority of the very deep values
were recorded for earthquakes somewhere in Fiji, with a particular concentration
around the small volcanic island of Ndoi. The analysis could continue to get
more complex, for example, by parsing the text to group together all earthquakes
recorded in the greater region, which would reveal that after Fiji, other very deep
earthquakes have been recorded around Vanuatu and the Philippines.
Anomalies can come in the form of misspellings, variations in capitalization, or
other text errors. The ease of finding these depends on the number of distinct
values, or cardinality, of the field. Differences in capitalization can be detected
by counting both the distinct values and the distinct values when a lower or
upper function is applied:
SELECT count(distinct type) as distinct_types
,count(distinct lower(type)) as distinct_lower
FROM earthquakes
;
distinct_types  distinct_lower
--------------  --------------
25              24
There are 24 distinct values of the type field, but 25 different forms. To find the
specific types, we can use a calculation to flag those values whose lowercase
form doesn’t match the actual value. Including the count of records for each
form will help contextualize so that we can later decide how to handle the
values:
SELECT type
,lower(type)
,type = lower(type) as flag
,count(*) as records
FROM earthquakes
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 2,4 desc
;
type       lower      flag   records

## Page 342

---------  ---------  -----  -------
...        ...        ...    ...
explosion  explosion  true   9887
ice quake  ice quake  true   10136
Ice Quake  ice quake  false  1
...        ...        ...    ...
The anomalous value of “Ice quake” is easy to spot, since it is the only value for
which the flag calculation returns false. Since there is only one record with
this value, compared to 10,136 with the lowercase form, we can assume that it
can be grouped together with the other records. Other text functions can be
applied, such as trim if we suspect that the values contain extra leading or
trailing spaces, or replace if we suspect that certain spellings have multiple
forms, such as the number “2” and the word “two.”
Misspellings can be more difficult to discover than other variations. If a known
set of correct values and spellings exists, it can be used to validate the data either
through an OUTER JOIN to a table containing the values or with a CASE
statement combined with an IN list. In either case, the goal is to flag values that
are unexpected or invalid. Without such a set of correct values, our options are
often either to apply domain knowledge or to make educated guesses. In the
earthquakes table, we can look at the type values with only a few records
and then try to determine if there is another, more common value that can be
substituted:
SELECT type, count(*) as records
FROM earthquakes
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
type                        records
--------------------------  -------

induced or triggered event  1

## Page 343

Ice Quake                   1
rockslide                   1
We looked at “Ice Quake” previously and decided it was likely the same as “ice
quake.” There is only one record for “rockslide,” though we might consider this
close enough to another of the values, “landslide,” which has 15 records.
“Collapse” is more ambiguous, since the data set includes both “mine collapse”
and “building collapse.” What we do with these, or whether we do anything at
all, depends on the goal of the analysis, as I’ll discuss later in “Handling
Anomalies”.
Anomalous Counts or Frequencies
Sometimes anomalies come not in the form of individual values but in the form
of patterns or clusters of activity in the data. For example, a customer spending
$100 on an ecommerce site may not be unusual, but that same customer
spending $100 every hour over the course of 48 hours would almost certainly be
an anomaly.
There are a number of dimensions on which clusters of activity can indicate
anomalies, many of them dependent on the context of the data. Time and
location are both common across many data sets and are features of the
earthquakes data set, so I will use them to illustrate the techniques in this
section. Keep in mind that these techniques can often be applied to other
attributes as well.
Events that happen with unusual frequency over a short time span can indicate
anomalous activity. This can be good, such as when a celebrity unexpectedly
promotes a product, leading to a burst of sales of that product. They can also be
bad, such as when unusual spikes indicate fraudulent credit card use or attempts
to bring a website down with a flood of traffic. To understand these types of
anomalies and whether there are deviations from the normal trend, we first apply
appropriate aggregations and then use the techniques introduced earlier in this
chapter, along with time series analysis techniques discussed in Chapter 3.
In the following examples, I’ll go through a series of steps and queries that will
help us understand the normal patterns and hunt for unusual ones. This is an
iterative process that uses data profiling, domain knowledge, and insights from

## Page 344

previous query results to guide each step. We’ll start our journey by checking the
counts of earthquakes by year, which we can do by truncating the time field to
the year level, and counting the records. For databases that don’t support
date_trunc, consider extract or trunc instead:
SELECT date_trunc('year',time)::date as earthquake_year
,count(*) as earthquakes
FROM earthquakes
GROUP BY 1
;
earthquake_year  earthquakes
---------------  -----------
2010-01-01       122322
2011-01-01       107397
2012-01-01       105693
2013-01-01       114368
2014-01-01       135247
2015-01-01       122914
2016-01-01       122420
2017-01-01       130622
2018-01-01       179304
2019-01-01       171116
2020-01-01       184523
We can see that 2011 and 2012 had low numbers of earthquakes compared to
other years. There was also a sharp increase in records in 2018 that was
sustained through 2019 and 2020. This seems unusual, and we can hypothesize
that the earth became more seismically active suddenly, that there is an error in
the data such as duplication of records, or that something changed in the data
collection process. Let’s drill down to month level to see if this trend persists at a
more granular level of time:
SELECT date_trunc('month',time)::date as earthquake_month
,count(*) as earthquakes
FROM earthquakes
GROUP BY 1
;
earthquake_month  earthquakes
----------------  -----------
2010-01-01        9651
2010-02-01        7697
2010-03-01        7750

## Page 345

...               ...
The output is displayed in Figure 6-10. We can see that although the number of
earthquakes varies from month to month, there does appear to be an overall
increase starting in 2017. We can also see that there are three outlier months, in
April 2010, July 2018, and July 2019.
Figure 6-10. Number of earthquakes per month
From here we can continue checking the data at more granular time periods,
perhaps optionally filtering the result set by a range of dates to focus in on these
anomalous stretches of time. After narrowing in on the specific days or even
times of day to pinpoint when the spikes occurred, we might want to break the
data down further by other attributes in the data set. This can help explain the
anomalies or at least narrow down the conditions in which they occurred. For
example, it turns out that the increase in earthquakes starting in 2017 can be at
least partially explained by the status field. The status indicates whether the
event has been reviewed by a human (“reviewed”) or was directly posted by a
system without review (“automatic”):

## Page 346

SELECT date_trunc('month',time)::date as earthquake_month
,status
,count(*) as earthquakes
FROM earthquakes
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1
;
earthquake_month  status     earthquakes
----------------  --------   -----------
2010-01-01        automatic  620
2010-01-01        reviewed   9031
2010-02-01        automatic  695
...               ...        ...
The trends of “automatic” and “reviewed” status are plotted in Figure 6-11.

## Page 348

Figure 6-11. Number of earthquakes per month, split by status
In the graph, we can see that the outlier counts in July 2018 and July 2019 are
due to large increases in the number of “automatic”-status earthquakes, whereas
the spike in April 2010 was in “reviewed”-status earthquakes. A new type of
automatic recording equipment may have been added to the data set in 2017, or
perhaps there hasn’t been enough time to review all the recordings yet.
Analyzing location in data sets that have that information can be another
powerful way to find and understand anomalies. The earthquakes table
contains information about many thousands of very small earthquakes,
potentially obscuring our view of the very large, very noteworthy earthquakes.
Let’s look at the locations of the biggest quakes, those of magnitude 6 or larger,
and see where they cluster geographically:
SELECT place, count(*) as earthquakes
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag >= 6
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
place                                 earthquakes
------------------------------------  -----------
near the east coast of Honshu, Japan  52
off the east coast of Honshu, Japan   34
Vanuatu                               28
...                                   ...
In contrast to time, where we queried at progressively more granular levels, the
place values are already so granular that it’s a bit difficult to grasp the full
picture, although the Honshu, Japan, region clearly stands out. We can apply
some of the text analysis techniques from Chapter 5 to parse and then group the
geographic information. In this case, we’ll use split_part to remove the
direction text (such as “near the coast of” or “100km N of”) that often appears at
the beginning of the place field:
SELECT 
case when place like '% of %' then split_part(place,' of ',2)
     else place
     end as place
,count(*) as earthquakes

## Page 349

FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag >= 6
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
place                  earthquakes
---------------------  -----------
Honshu, Japan          89
Vanuatu                28
Lata, Solomon Islands  28
...                    ...
The region around Honshu, Japan, experienced 89 earthquakes, making it not
only the location of the largest earthquake in the data set but also an outlier in
the number of very large earthquakes recorded. We could continue to parse,
clean, and group the place values to gain a more refined picture of where
major earthquakes occur in the world.
Finding anomalous counts, sums, or frequencies in data is usually an exercise
that involves a number of rounds of querying different levels of granularity in
succession. It’s common to start broad, then go more granular, zoom out again to
compare to baseline trends, and zoom in again on specific splits or dimensions of
the data. Fortunately, SQL is a great tool for this sort of rapid iteration.
Combining techniques, especially from time series analysis, discussed in
Chapter 3, and text analysis, discussed in Chapter 5, will bring even more
richness to the analysis.
Anomalies from the Absence of Data
We’ve seen how unusually high frequencies of events can signal anomalies.
Keep in mind that the absence of records can also signal anomalies. For
example, the heartbeat of a patient undergoing surgery is monitored. The
absence of a heartbeat at any time generates an alert, as do irregularities in the
heartbeat. In many contexts, however, detecting the absence of data is difficult if
you’re not specifically looking for it. Customers don’t always announce they are
about to churn. They simply stop using the product or service and quietly drop
out of the data set.
One way to ensure that absences in data are noticed is to use techniques from

## Page 350

cohort analysis, discussed in Chapter 4. In particular, a JOIN to a date series or
data dimension, to ensure that a record exists for every entity whether or not it
was present in that time period, makes absences easier to detect.
Another way to detect absence is to query for gaps, or time since last seen. Some
regions are more prone to large earthquakes due to the way tectonic plates are
arranged around the globe. We’ve also detected some of this in the data in our
previous examples. Earthquakes are notoriously hard to predict, even when we
have a sense of where they are likely to occur. This doesn’t stop some people
from speculating about the next “big one” simply due to the amount of time that
has passed since the last one. We can use SQL to find the gaps between large
earthquakes and the time since the most recent one:
SELECT place
,extract('days' from '2020-12-31 23:59:59' - latest) 
 as days_since_latest
,count(*) as earthquakes
,extract('days' from avg(gap)) as avg_gap
,extract('days' from max(gap)) as max_gap
FROM
(
    SELECT place
    ,time
    ,lead(time) over (partition by place order by time) as next_time
    ,lead(time) over (partition by place order by time) - time as gap
    ,max(time) over (partition by place) as latest
    FROM
    (
        SELECT 
        replace(
          initcap(
          case when place ~ ', [A-Z]' then split_part(place,', ',2)
               when place like '% of %' then split_part(place,' of 
',2)
               else place end
        )
        ,'Region','')
        as place
        ,time
        FROM earthquakes
        WHERE mag > 5
    ) a
) a         
GROUP BY 1,2        
;

## Page 351

place             days_since_latest  earthquakes  avg_gap  max_gap

...               ...                ...          ...      ...
In the innermost subquery, the place field is parsed and cleaned, returning
larger regions or countries, along with the time of each earthquake, for all
earthquakes of magnitude 5 or greater. The second subquery uses a lead
function to find the time of the next earthquake, if any, for each place and time,
and the gap between each earthquake and the next one. The max window
function returns the most recent earthquake for each place. The outer query
calculates the days since the latest 5+ earthquake in the data set, using the
extract function to return just the days from the interval that is returned when
two dates are subtracted. Since the data set includes records only through the end
of 2020, the timestamp “2020-12-31 23:59:59” is used, though
current_timestamp or an equivalent expression would be appropriate if the
data were refreshed on an ongoing basis. Days are extracted in a similar fashion
from the average and max of the gap value.
The time since the last major earthquake in a location may have little predictive
power in practice, but in many domains, gaps and time since last seen metrics
have practical applications. Understanding typical gaps between actions sets a
baseline against which the current gap can be compared. When the current gap is
within range of historical values, we might judge that a customer is retained, but
when the current gap is much longer, the risk of churn increases. The result set
from a query that returns historical gaps can itself become the subject of an
anomaly detection analysis, answering questions such as the longest amount of
time that a customer was gone before subsequently returning.
Handling Anomalies
Anomalies can appear in data sets for a number of reasons and can take a
number of forms, as we’ve just seen. After detecting anomalies, the next step is
to handle them in some fashion. How this is done depends on both the source of

## Page 352

the anomaly—underlying process or data quality issue—and the end goal of the
data set or analysis. The options include investigation without changes, removal,
replacement, rescaling, and fixing upstream.
Investigation
Finding, or attempting to find, the cause of an anomaly is usually the first step in
deciding what to do with it. This part of the process can be both fun and
frustrating—fun in the sense that tracking down and solving a mystery engages
our skills and creativity, but frustrating in the sense that we’re often working
under time pressure and tracking down anomalies can feel like going down an
endless series of rabbit holes, leading us to wonder whether an entire analysis is
flawed.
When I’m investigating anomalies, my process usually involves a series of
queries that bounce back and forth between searching for patterns and looking at
specific examples. A true outlier value is easy to spot. In such cases, I will
usually query for the entire row that contains the outlier for clues as to the
timing, source, and any other attributes that are available. Next, I’ll check
records that share those attributes to see if they have values that seem unusual.
For example, I might check to see whether other records on the same day have
normal or unusual values. Traffic from a particular website or purchases of a
particular product might reveal other anomalies.
After investigating the source and attributes of anomalies when working on data
produced internally in my organization, I get in touch with the stakeholders or
product owners. Sometimes there is a known bug or flaw, but often enough there
is a real issue in a process or system that needs to be addressed, and context
information is useful. For external or public data sets, there may not be an
opportunity to find the root cause. In these cases, my goal is to gather enough
information to decide which of the options discussed next is appropriate.
Removal
One option for dealing with data anomalies is to simply remove them from the
data set. If there is reason to suspect that there was an error in the data collection
that might affect the entire record, removal is appropriate. Removal is also a

## Page 353

good option when the data set is large enough that dropping a few records is
unlikely to affect the conclusions. Another good reason to use removal is when
the outliers are so extreme that they would skew the results enough that entirely
inappropriate conclusions would be drawn.
We saw previously that the earthquakes data set contains a number of
records with a magnitude of –9.99 and a few with –9. Since the earthquakes
these values would correspond to are extremely small, we might suspect that
they are erroneous values or were simply entered when the actual magnitude was
unknown. Removing records with these values is straightforward in the WHERE
clause:
SELECT time, mag, type
FROM earthquakes
WHERE mag not in (-9,-9.99)
limit 100
;
time                 mag   type
-------------------  ----  ----------
2019-08-11 03:29:20  4.3   earthquake
2019-08-11 03:27:19  0.32  earthquake
2019-08-11 03:25:39  1.8   earthquake
Before removing the records, however, we might want to determine whether
including the outliers actually makes a difference to the output. For example, we
might want to know if removing the outliers affects the average magnitude, since
averages can easily be skewed by outliers. We can do this by calculating the
average across the entire data set, as well as the average excluding the extreme
low values, using a CASE statement to exclude them:
SELECT avg(mag) as avg_mag
,avg(case when mag > -9 then mag end) as avg_mag_adjusted
FROM earthquakes
;
avg_mag               avg_mag_adjusted
------------------    ------------------
1.6251015161530643    1.6273225642983641
The averages are different only at the third significant digit (1.625 versus 1.627),

## Page 354

which is a fairly small difference. However, if we filter just to Yellowstone
National Park, where many of the –9.99 values occur, the difference is more
dramatic:
SELECT avg(mag) as avg_mag
,avg(case when mag > -9 then mag end) as avg_mag_adjusted
FROM earthquakes
WHERE place = 'Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming'
;
avg_mag                 avg_mag_adjusted
----------------------  ----------------------
0.40639347873981053095  0.92332793709528214616
Although these are still small values, the difference between an average of 0.46
and 0.92 is big enough that we would likely choose to remove the outliers.
Notice that there are two options for doing so: either in the WHERE clause,
which removes the outliers from all the results, or in a CASE statement, which
removes them only from specific calculations. Which option you choose
depends on the context of the analysis, as well as on whether it is important to
preserve the rows in order to retain total counts, or useful values in other fields.
Replacement with Alternate Values
Anomalous values can often be handled by replacing them with other values
rather than removing entire records. An alternate value can be a default, a
substitute value, the nearest numerical value within a range, or a summary
statistic such as the average or median.
We’ve seen previously that null values can be replaced with a default using the
coalesce function. When values are not necessarily null but are problematic
for some other reason, a CASE statement can be used to substitute a default
value. For example, rather than report on all the various seismic events, we
might want to group the types that are not earthquakes into a single “Other”
value:
SELECT 
case when type = 'earthquake' then type
     else 'Other'
     end as event_type

## Page 355

,count(*)
FROM earthquakes
GROUP BY 1
;
event_type  count
----------  -------
earthquake  1461750
Other       34176
This reduces the amount of detail in the data, of course, but it can also be a way
to summarize a data set that has a number of outlier values for type, as we saw
previously. When you know that outlier values are incorrect, and you know the
correct value, replacing them with a CASE statement is also a solution that
preserves the row in the overall data set. For example, an extra 0 might have
been added to the end of a record, or a value might have been recorded in inches
instead of miles.
Another option for handling numeric outliers is to replace the extreme values
with the nearest high or low value that is not extreme. This approach maintains
much of the range of values but prevents misleading averages that can result
from extreme outliers. Winsorization is a specific technique for this, where
outliers are set to a specific percentile of the data. For example, values above the
95th percentile are set to the 95th percentile value, while values below the 5th
percentile are set to the 5th percentile value. To calculate this in SQL, we first
calculate the 5th and 95th percentile values:
SELECT percentile_cont(0.95) within group (order by mag) 
 as percentile_95
,percentile_cont(0.05) within group (order by mag) 
 as percentile_05
FROM earthquakes
;
percentile_95  percentile_05
-------------  -------------
4.5            0.12
We can put this calculation in a subquery and then use a CASE statement to
handle setting values for outliers below the 5th percentile and above the 95th.
Note the Cartesian JOIN that allows us to compare the percentile values with

## Page 356

each individual magnitude:
SELECT a.time, a.place, a.mag
,case when a.mag > b.percentile_95 then b.percentile_95
      when a.mag < b.percentile_05 then b.percentile_05
      else a.mag
      end as mag_winsorized
FROM earthquakes a
JOIN
(
    SELECT percentile_cont(0.95) within group (order by mag) 
     as percentile_95
    ,percentile_cont(0.05) within group (order by mag)

The 5th percentile value is 0.12, while the 95th percentile is 4.5. Values below
and above these thresholds are changed to the threshold in the
mag_winsorize field. Values between these thresholds remain the same.
There is no set percentile threshold for winsorizing. The 1st and 99th percentiles
or even the 0.01th and 99.9th percentiles can be used depending on the
requirements for the analysis and how prevalent and extreme the outliers are.
Rescaling
Rather than filtering out records or changing the values of outliers, rescaling
values provides a path that retains all the values but makes analysis and graphing
easier.
We discussed the z-score previously, but it’s worth pointing out that this can be

## Page 357

used as a way to rescale values. The z-score is useful because it can be used with
both positive and negative values.
Another common transformation is converting to logarithmic (log) scale. The
benefit of transforming values into log scale is that they retain the same ordering,
but small numbers get spread out more. Log transformations can also be
transformed back into the original scale, easing interpretation. A downside is that
the log transformation cannot be used on negative numbers. In the
earthquakes data set, we learned that the magnitude is already expressed in
log scale. The magnitude 9.1 Great Tohoku Earthquake is extreme, but the value
would appear even more extreme were it not expressed in log scale!
The depth field is measured in kilometers. Here we’ll query both the depth and
the depth with the log function applied and then graph the output in Figures 6-
12 and 6-13 in order to demonstrate the difference. The log function uses base
10 as a default. To reduce the result set for easier graphing, the depth is also
rounded to one significant digit using the round function. The table is filtered
to exclude values less than 0.05, as these would round to zero or less than zero:
SELECT round(depth,1) as depth
,log(round(depth,1)) as log_depth
,count(*) as earthquakes
FROM earthquakes
WHERE depth >= 0.05
GROUP BY 1,2

## Page 359

In Figure 6-12, it’s apparent that there are a large number of earthquakes
between 0.05 and maybe 20, but beyond that it’s difficult to see the distribution
since the x-axis stretches all the way to 700 to capture the range of the data.
When the depth is transformed to a log scale in Figure 6-13, however, the
distribution of the smaller values is much easier to see. Notably, the spike at 1.0,
which corresponds to a depth of 10 kilometers, is apparent.
TIP
Other types of scale transformations, while not necessarily appropriate for removing outliers,
can be accomplished with SQL. Some common ones include:
Square root: use the sqrt function
Cube root: use the cbrt function
Reciprocal transformation: 1 / field_name
Change the units, such as inches to feet or pounds to kilograms: multiply or divide by the
appropriate conversion factor with * or /.
Rescaling can be done in SQL code, or often alternatively in the software or
coding language used for graphing. The log transformation is particularly useful
when there is a large spread of positive values and the patterns that are important
to detect exist in the lower values.
As with all analysis, deciding how to handle anomalies depends on the purpose
and the amount of context or domain knowledge you have about the data set.
Removing outliers is the simplest method, but to retain all the records,
techniques such as winsorizing and rescaling work well.
Conclusion
Anomaly detection is a common practice in analysis. The goal may be to detect
the outliers, or it may be to manipulate them in order to prepare a data set for
further analysis. In either case, the basic tools of sorting, calculating percentiles,
and graphing the output of SQL queries can help you find them efficiently.
Anomalies come in many varieties, with outlying values, unusual bursts of
activity, and unusual absences being most common. Domain knowledge is

## Page 360

almost always helpful as you go through the process of finding and gathering
information about the causes of anomalies. Options for dealing with anomalies
include investigation, removal, replacement with alternate values, and rescaling
the data. The choice depends heavily on the goal, but any of these paths can be
accomplished with SQL. In the next chapter, we’ll turn our attention to
experimentation, where the goal is to figure out whether a whole group of
subjects differs from the norm of the control group.

Chapter 7. Experiment Analysis
Experimentation, also known as A/B testing or split testing, is considered the
gold standard for establishing causality. Much data analysis work involves
establishing correlations: one thing is more likely to happen when another thing
also happens, whether that be an action, an attribute, or a seasonal pattern.
You’ve probably heard the saying “correlation does not imply causation,”
however, and it is exactly this problem in data analysis that experimentation
attempts to solve.
All experiments begin with a hypothesis: a guess about behavioral change that
will result from some alteration to a product, process, or message. The change
might be to a user interface, a new user onboarding flow, an algorithm that
powers recommendations, marketing messaging or timing, or any number of
other areas. If the organization built it or has control over it, it can be
experimented on, at least in theory. Hypotheses are often driven by other data
analysis work. For example, we might find that a high percentage of people drop
out of the checkout flow, and we could hypothesize that more people might
complete the checkout process if the number of steps were reduced.
The second element necessary for any experiment is a success metric. The
behavioral change we hypothesize might be related to form completion,
purchase conversion, click-through, retention, engagement, or any other
behavior that is important to the organization’s mission. The success metric
should quantify this behavior, be reasonably easy to measure, and be sensitive
enough to detect a change. Click-through, checkout completion, and time to
complete a process are often good success metrics. Retention and customer
satisfaction are often less suitable success metrics, despite being very important,
because they are frequently influenced by many factors beyond what is being
tested in any individual experiment and thus are less sensitive to the changes
we’d like to test. Good success metrics are often ones that you already track as
part of understanding company or organizational health.
TIP

## Page 362

You may wonder whether an experiment can have multiple success metrics. Certainly with
SQL, it is usually possible to generate many different calculations and metrics. You should be
aware of the multiple comparisons problem, however. I won’t go into a full explanation here,
but the gist is that the more places you look for a significant change, the more likely you are to
find one. Check one metric, and you may or may not find a significant change in one of the
experiment variants. Check 20 metrics, however, and there’s a pretty good chance that at least
one will show significance, whether or not the experiment had anything to do with that metric
in the first place. As a rule of thumb, there should be one or maybe two primary success
metrics. One to five additional metrics may be used for downside protection. These are
sometimes called guardrail metrics. For example, you may want to ensure that an experiment
doesn’t hurt page-loading time, even though it’s not the goal of the experiment to improve it.
The third element of experimentation is a system that randomly assigns entities
to a control or experiment variant group and alters the experience accordingly.
This type of system is also sometimes called a cohorting system. A number of
software vendors offer experiment-cohorting tools, though some organizations
choose to build them internally in order to achieve more flexibility. Either way,
to perform experiment analysis with SQL, the entity-level assignment data must
flow into a table in the database that also contains behavioral data.
TIP
The discussions of experiments in this chapter specifically refer to online experiments, in
which variant assignment happens through a computer system and behavior is tracked
digitally. There are certainly many types of experiments performed across science and social
science disciplines. A key difference is that the success metrics and behaviors that are
examined in online experiments are usually already tracked for other purposes, whereas in
many scientific studies, the resulting behavior is tracked specifically for the experiment and
only during the period of the experiment. With online experiments, we sometimes need to be
creative about finding metrics that are good proxies for an impact when a direct measurement
isn’t possible.
With a hypothesis, a success metric, and a variant cohorting system in place, you
can run experiments, collect the data, and analyze the outcomes using SQL.
Strengths and Limits of Experiment Analysis
with SQL

## Page 363

SQL is useful for analyzing experiments. In many cases with experiment
analysis, the experiment cohort data and behavioral data are already flowing into
a database, making SQL a natural choice. Success metrics are often already part
of an organization’s reporting and analysis vocabulary, with SQL queries already
developed. Joining variant assignment data to existing query logic is often
relatively straightforward.
SQL is a good choice for automating experiment result reporting. The same
query can be run for each experiment, substituting the name or identifier of the
experiment in the WHERE clause. Many organizations with high volumes of
experiments have created standardized reports to speed up readouts and simplify
the interpretation process.
While SQL is useful for many of the steps involved with experiment analysis, it
does have one major shortcoming: SQL is not able to calculate statistical
significance. Many databases allow developers to extend SQL functionality with
user-defined functions (UDFs). UDFs may be able to leverage statistical tests
from languages such as Python, but they are beyond the scope of this book. A
good option is to calculate summary statistics in SQL and then use an online
calculator such as the one provided at Evanmiller.org to determine whether the
experiment result is statistically significant.
WHY CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION: HOW VALUES
CAN RELATE TO EACH OTHER
It’s easier to prove that two values are correlated (they rise or fall together,
or one exists primarily in the presence of the other) than it is to prove that
one causes the other. Why is this the case? Although our brains are wired to
detect causality, there are actually five ways in which two values, X and Y,
can relate to each other:
1. X causes Y: This is of course what we’re all trying to find. Through
some mechanism, Y is the result of X.
2. Y causes X: The relationship is there, but the direction of causality
is reversed. For example, umbrellas don’t cause rain, but rather the
presence of rain causes people to use umbrellas.

## Page 364

3. X and Y have a common cause: The values are related because there
is some third variable that explains both of them. Sales of ice cream
and use of air conditioners both rise in the summer, but neither
causes the other. Higher temperatures cause both increases.
4. A feedback loop exists between X and Y: When Y increases, X
increases to compensate, which leads to Y increasing in turn, and so
on. This can happen when a customer is in the process of churning
from a service. Fewer interactions lead to fewer items to suggest or
remind, which leads to fewer interactions, and so on. Did the lack of
recommendations cause less engagement, or is it the other way
around?
5. There is no relationship; it’s just random: Search long enough and
you will find metrics that are correlated even though there is no
actual relationship between them. 
The Data Set
For this chapter, we will use a data set for a mobile game from the fictional
Tanimura Studios. There are four tables. The game_users table contains
records for people who downloaded the mobile game, along with the date and
country. A sample of the data is shown in Figure 7-1.

## Page 365

Figure 7-1. Sample of the game_users table
The game_actions table contains records for things the users did in the
game. A sample of the data is shown in Figure 7-2.

## Page 366

Figure 7-2. Sample of the game_actions table
The game_purchases table tracks purchases of in-game currency in US
dollars. A sample of the data is shown in Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-3. Sample of the game_purchases table
Finally, the exp_assignment table contains records of which variant users
were assigned to for a particular experiment. A sample of the data is shown in
Figure 7-4.

## Page 367

Figure 7-4. Sample of the exp_assignment table
All of the data in these tables is fictional, created with random number
generators, though the structure is similar to what you might see in the database
of a real digital gaming company. 
Types of Experiments
There is a wide range of experiments. If you can change something that a user,
customer, constituent, or other entity experiences, you can in theory test that
change. From an analysis standpoint, there are two main types of experiments:
those with binary outcomes and those with continuous outcomes.
Experiments with Binary Outcomes: The Chi-Squared Test
As you might expect, a binary outcome experiment has only two outcomes:
either an action is taken or it isn’t. Either a user completes a registration flow or
they don’t. A consumer clicks on a website ad or they don’t. A student graduates
or they don’t. For these types of experiments, we calculate the proportion of each
variant that completes the action. The numerator is the number of completers,

## Page 368

while the denominator is all units that were exposed. This metric is also
described as a rate: completion rate, click-through rate, graduation rate, and so
on.
To determine whether the rates in the variants are statistically different, we can
use the chi-squared test, which is a statistical test for categorical variables.  Data
for a chi-squared test is often shown in the form of a contingency table, which
shows the frequency of observations at the intersection of two attributes. This
looks just like a pivot table to those who are familiar with that type of table.
Let’s take a look at an example, using our mobile game data set. A product
manager has introduced a new version of the onboarding flow, a series of screens
that teach a new player how the game works. The product manager hopes that
the new version will increase the number of players who complete the
onboarding and start their first game session. The new version was introduced in
an experiment called “Onboarding” that assigned users to either control or
variant 1, as tracked in the exp_assignment table. An event called
“onboarding complete” in the game_actions table indicates whether a user
completed the onboarding flow.
The contingency table shows the frequency at the intersection of the variant
assignment (control or variant 1) and whether or not onboarding was completed.
We can use a query to find the values for the table. Here we count the number
of users with and without an “onboarding complete” action and GROUP BY the
variant:
SELECT a.variant
,count(case when b.user_id is not null then a.user_id end) as 
completed
,count(case when b.user_id is null then a.user_id end) as 
not_completed
FROM exp_assignment a
LEFT JOIN game_actions b on a.user_id = b.user_id
 and b.action = 'onboarding complete'
WHERE a.exp_name = 'Onboarding'
GROUP BY 1
;
variant    completed  not_completed
---------  ---------  -------------
control    36268      13629
variant 1  38280      11995

## Page 369

Adding totals for each row and column turns this output into a contingency table,
as in Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-5. Contingency table for onboarding completions
To make use of one of the online significance calculators, we will need the
number of successes, or times when the action was taken, and the total number
cohorted for each variant. The SQL to find the required data points is
straightforward. The assigned variant and the count of users assigned to that
variant are queried from the exp_assignment table. We then LEFT JOIN the
game_actions table to find the count of users who completed onboarding.
The LEFT JOIN is required since we expect that not all users completed the
relevant action. Finally, we find the percent completed in each variant by
dividing the number of users who completed by the total number cohorted:
SELECT a.variant
,count(a.user_id) as total_cohorted
,count(b.user_id) as completions
,count(b.user_id) / count(a.user_id) as pct_completed
FROM exp_assignment a
LEFT JOIN game_actions b on a.user_id = b.user_id
 and b.action = 'onboarding complete'
WHERE a.exp_name = 'Onboarding'
GROUP BY 1
;

## Page 370

variant    total_cohorted  completions  pct_completed
---------  --------------  -----------  -------------
control    49897           36268        0.7269
variant 1  50275           38280        0.7614
We can see that variant 1 did indeed have more completions than the control
experience, with 76.14% completing compared to 72.69%. But is this difference
statistically significant, allowing us to reject the hypothesis that there is no
difference? For this, we plug our results into an online calculator and confirm
that the completion rate for variant 1 was significantly higher at a 95%
confidence level than the completion rate for the control. Variant 1 can be
declared the winner.
TIP
A 95% confidence level is commonly used, although this is not the only option. There are
many online articles and discussions about the meaning of confidence levels, which level to
use, and adjustments in scenarios in which you are comparing multiple variants to a control.
Binary outcome experiments follow this basic pattern. Calculate the successes or
completions as well as the total members in each variant. The SQL used to
derive the success events may be more complicated depending on the tables and
how actions are stored in the database, but the output is consistent. Next, we’ll
turn to experiments with continuous outcomes.
Experiments with Continuous Outcomes: The t-Test
Many experiments seek to improve continuous metrics, rather than the binary
outcomes discussed in the last section. Continuous metrics can take on a range of
values. Examples include amount spent by customers, time spent on page, and
days an app is used. Ecommerce sites often want to increase sales, and so they
might experiment on product pages or checkout flows. Content sites may test
layout, navigation, and headlines to try to increase the number of stories read. A
company running an app might run a remarketing campaign to remind users to
come back to the app.
For these and other experiments with continuous success metrics, the goal is to

## Page 371

figure out whether the average values in each variant differ from each other in a
statistically significant way. The relevant statistical test is the two-sample t-test,
which determines whether we can reject the null hypothesis that the averages are
equal with a defined confidence interval, usually 95%. The statistical test has
three inputs, all of which are straightforward to calculate with SQL: the mean,
the standard deviation, and the count of observations.
Let’s take a look at an example using our game data. In the last section, we
looked at whether a new onboarding flow increased the completion rate. Now
we will consider whether that new flow increased user spending on in-game
currency. The success metric is the amount spent, so we need to calculate the
mean and standard deviation of this value for each variant. First we need to
calculate the amount per user, since users can make multiple purchases. Retrieve
the cohort assignment from the exp_assignment table and count the users.
Next, LEFT JOIN to the game_purchases table to gather the amount data.
The LEFT JOIN is required since not all users make a purchase, but we still need
to include them in the mean and standard deviation calculations. For users
without purchases, the amount is set to a default of 0 with coalesce. Since the
avg and stddev functions ignore nulls, the 0 default is required to ensure that
these records are included. The outer query summarizes the output values by
variant:
SELECT variant
,count(user_id) as total_cohorted
,avg(amount) as mean_amount
,stddev(amount) as stddev_amount
FROM
(
    SELECT a.variant
    ,a.user_id
    ,sum(coalesce(b.amount,0)) as amount
    FROM exp_assignment a
    LEFT JOIN game_purchases b on a.user_id = b.user_id
    WHERE a.exp_name = 'Onboarding'
    GROUP BY 1,2
) a
GROUP BY 1
;
variant    total_cohorted  mean_amount  stddev_amount
---------  --------------  -----------  -------------
control    49897           3.781        18.940

## Page 372

variant 1  50275           3.688        19.220
Next, we plug these values into an online calculator and find that there is no
significant difference between the control and variant groups at a 95%
confidence interval. The “variant 1” group appears to have increased onboarding
completion rates but not the amount spent.
Another question we might consider is whether variant 1 affected spending
among those users who completed the onboarding. Those who don’t complete
the onboarding never make it into the game and therefore don’t even have the
opportunity to make a purchase. To answer this question, we can use a query
similar to the previous one, but we’ll add an INNER JOIN to the
game_actions table to restrict the users counted to only those who have an
action of “onboarding complete”:
SELECT variant
,count(user_id) as total_cohorted
,avg(amount) as mean_amount
,stddev(amount) as stddev_amount
FROM
(
    SELECT a.variant
    ,a.user_id
    ,sum(coalesce(b.amount,0)) as amount
    FROM exp_assignment a
    LEFT JOIN game_purchases b on a.user_id = b.user_id
    JOIN game_actions c on a.user_id = c.user_id
     and c.action = 'onboarding complete'
    WHERE a.exp_name = 'Onboarding'
    GROUP BY 1,2
) a
GROUP BY 1
;
variant    total_cohorted  mean_amount  stddev_amount
---------  --------------  -----------  -------------
control    36268           5.202        22.049
variant 1  38280           4.843        21.899
Plugging these values into the calculator reveals that the average for the control
group is statistically significantly higher than that for variant 1 at a 95%
confidence interval. This result may seem perplexing, but it illustrates why it is
so important to agree on the success metric for an experiment up front. The

## Page 373

experiment variant 1 had a positive effect on onboarding completion and so can
be judged a success. It did not have an effect on the overall spending level. This
could be due to a mix shift: the additional users who made it through onboarding
in variant 1 were less likely to pay. If the underlying hypothesis was that
increasing onboarding completion rates would increase revenue, then the
experiment should not be judged a success, and the product managers should
come up with some new ideas to test.
Challenges with Experiments and Options for
Rescuing Flawed Experiments
Although experimentation is the gold standard for understanding causality, there
are a number of ways experiments can go wrong. If the entire premise is flawed,
there won’t be much that SQL can do to save the day. If the flaw is more
technical in nature, we may be able to query the data in such a way as to adjust
or exclude problematic data points and still interpret some results. Running
experiments has a cost in terms of the time spent by engineers, designers, or
marketers who create variants. It also has opportunity cost, or the missed benefit
that could have been gained by sending customers down an optimal conversion
path or product experience. On a practical level, using SQL to help the
organization at least learn something from an experiment is often time well
spent.
Variant Assignment
Random assignment of experiment units (which can be users, sessions, or other
entities) to control and variant groups is one of the key elements of
experimentation. However, sometimes errors in the assignment process happen,
whether because of a flaw in the experiment specification, a technical failure, or
a limitation in the cohorting software. As a result, the control and variant groups
may be of unequal sizes, fewer overall entities may have been cohorted than
expected, or the assignment may not have actually been random.
SQL can sometimes help salvage an experiment in which too many units were
cohorted. I have seen this happen when an experiment is meant to target only
new users but all users are cohorted instead. Another way this can happen is

## Page 374

when an experiment tests something that only a subset of users will see, either
because it is a few clicks into the experience or because certain conditions must
be met, such as previous purchase. Due to technical limitations, all users get
cohorted, even though a chunk of them would never see the experiment
treatment even if they are in that group. The solution is to add a JOIN into the
SQL that restricts the users or entities considered to only those that were
intended to be eligible. For example, in the case of a new user experiment, we
can add an INNER JOIN to a table or subquery that contains user registration
date and set a WHERE condition to exclude users who registered too far prior to
the cohort event to be considered new. The same strategy can be used when a
certain condition must be met to even see the experiment. Restrict the entities
included by excluding those that shouldn’t be eligible via JOINs and WHERE
conditions. After doing this, you should check to make sure that the resulting
population is a large enough sample to produce significant results.
If too few users or entities are cohorted, it’s important to check whether the
sample is large enough to produce significant results. If not, run the experiment
again. If the sample size is large enough, a second consideration is whether there
is bias in who or what was cohorted. As an example, I have seen cases in which
users on certain browsers or older app versions were not cohorted due to
technical limitations. If populations that were excluded aren’t random and
represent differences in location, technical savvy, or socioeconomic status, it’s
important to consider both how large this population is relative to the rest and
whether any adjustments should be made to include them in the final analysis.
Another possibility is that the variant assignment system is flawed and entities
are not assigned randomly. This is fairly unusual with most modern experiment
tools, but if it happens, it invalidates the whole experiment. Results that are “too
good to be true” might signal a variant assignment problem. I have seen, for
example, cases in which highly engaged users are accidentally assigned to both
treatment and control due to a change in experiment configuration. Careful data
profiling can check whether entities have been assigned to multiple variants or
whether users with high or low engagement prior to the experiment are clustered
in a particular variant.
TIP

## Page 375

Running an A/A test can help uncover flaws in the variant assignment software. In this type of
test, entities are cohorted and success metrics are compared, just like in any other experiment.
However, no changes are made to the experience, and both cohorts receive the control
experience. Since the groups receive the same experience, we should expect no significant
differences in the success metric. If it turns out there is a difference, further investigation
should be done to uncover and fix the problem.
Outliers
Statistical tests for analyzing continuous success metrics rely on averages. As a
result, they are sensitive to unusually high or low outlier values. I have seen
experiments in which the presence of one or two particularly high-spending
customers in a variant gives that variant a statistically significant edge over
others. Without those few high spenders, the result may be neutral or even the
reverse. In most cases, we are more interested in whether a treatment has an
effect across a range of individuals, and thus adjusting for these outliers can
make an experiment result more meaningful.
We discussed anomaly detection in Chapter 6, and experiment analysis is
another place in which those techniques can be applied. Outlier values can be
determined either by analyzing the experiment results or by finding the base rate
prior to the experiment. The outliers may be removed via a technique such as
winsorizing (also discussed in Chapter 6), which removes values beyond a
threshold, such as the 95th or 99th percentile. This can be done in SQL before
moving on to the rest of the experiment analysis.
Another option for dealing with outliers in continuous success metrics is to turn
the success metric into a binary outcome. For example, instead of comparing the
average spend across the control and variant groups, which may be distorted due
to a few very high spenders, compare the purchase rate between the two groups
and then follow the procedure discussed in the section on experiments with
binary outcomes. We could consider the conversion rate to purchaser among
users who completed onboarding in the control and variant 1 groups from the
“Onboarding” experiment:
SELECT a.variant
,count(distinct a.user_id) as total_cohorted
,count(distinct b.user_id) as purchasers

variant 1  38280           4981        0.0991
We can look at the numbers and observe that even though there are more users in
variant 1, there are fewer purchasers. The percentage of users who purchased in
the control group is 10%, compared to 9.91% for variant 1. Next, we plug the
data points into an online calculator. The conversion rate is statistically
significantly higher for the control group. In this case, even though the rate of
purchasing was higher for the control group, on a practical level we may be
willing to accept this small decline if we believe that more users completing the
onboarding process has other benefits. More players might boost rankings, for
example, and players who enjoy the game may spread it to their friends via word
of mouth, both of which can help growth and may then lead to attracting other
new players who will become purchasers.
The success metric can also be set to a threshold, and the share of entities
meeting that threshold compared. For example, the success metric could be
reading at least three stories or using an app at least two times a week. An
infinite number of metrics could be constructed in this way, so it’s important to
understand what is both important and meaningful to the organization.
Time Boxing
Experiments are often run over the course of several weeks. This means that
individuals who enter the experiment earlier have a longer window in which to
complete actions associated with the success metric. To control for this, we can
apply time boxing—imposing a fixed length of time relative to the experiment
entry date and considering actions only during that window. This concept was
also covered in Chapter 4.

## Page 377

For experiments, the appropriate size of the time box depends on what you are
measuring. The window could be as short as one hour when measuring an action
that typically has an immediate response, such as clicking on an ad. For purchase
conversion, experimenters often allow a window of 1 to 7 days. Shorter windows
allow experiments to be analyzed sooner, since all cohorted entities need to be
allowed the full time to complete actions. The best windows balance the need to
obtain results with the actual dynamics of the organization. If customers
typically convert in a few days, consider a 7-day window; if customers often
take 20 or more days, consider a 30-day window.
As an example, we can revise our first example from experiments with
continuous outcomes by only including purchases within 7 days of the cohorting
event. Note that it is important to use the time the entity was assigned to a
variant as the starting point of the time box. An additional ON clause is added,
restricting the results to purchases that occurred within the interval “7 days”:
SELECT variant
,count(user_id) as total_cohorted
,avg(amount) as mean_amount
,stddev(amount) as stddev_amount
FROM
(
    SELECT a.variant
    ,a.user_id
    ,sum(coalesce(b.amount,0)) as amount
    FROM exp_assignment a
    LEFT JOIN game_purchases b on a.user_id = b.user_id 
     and b.purch_date <= a.exp_date + interval '7 days'
    WHERE a.exp_name = 'Onboarding'
    GROUP BY 1,2
) a
GROUP BY 1
;
variant    total_cohorted  mean_amount  stddev_amount
---------  --------------  -----------  -------------
control    49897           1.369        5.766
variant 1  50275           1.352        5.613
The means are similar, and in fact statistically they are not significantly different
from each other. In this example, the time-boxed conclusion agrees with the
conclusion when there was no time box.

## Page 378

In this case, purchase events are relatively rare. For metrics that measure
common events and those that accumulate quickly, such as pageviews, clicks,
likes, and articles read, using a time box can prevent the earliest cohorted users
from looking substantially “better” than those cohorted later.
Repeated Exposure Experiments
In discussions of online experimentation, most examples are of what I like to call
“one-and-done” experiences: the user encounters a treatment once, reacts to it,
and does not pass that way again. User registration is a classic example: a
consumer signs up for a particular service only once, and therefore any changes
to the sign-up process affect only new users. Analyzing tests on these
experiences is relatively straightforward.
There is another type of experience that I call “repeated exposure,” in which an
individual comes into contact with the change many times during the course of
using a product or service. In any experiment involving these changes, we can
expect individuals to encounter them more than once. Changes to an app’s user
interface, such as color, text, and placement of important information and links,
are experienced by users throughout their app usage. Email marketing programs
that send customers reminders or promotions on a regular basis also have this
repeated exposure quality. Emails are experienced many times as subject lines in
the inbox, and as content if opened.
Measuring repeated exposure experiments is trickier than measuring one-and-
done experiments due to novelty effects and regression to the mean. A novelty
effect is the tendency for behavior to change just because something is new, not
because it is necessarily better. Regression to the mean is the tendency for
phenomena to return to an average level over time. As an example, changing any
part of a user interface tends to increase the number of people who interact with
it, whether it is a new button color, logo, or placement of functionality. Initially
the metrics look good, because the click-through rate or engagement goes up.
This is the novelty effect. But over time, users get used to the change, and they
tend to click or use the functionality at rates that return closer to the baseline.
This is the regression to the mean. The important question to answer when
running this kind of experiment is whether the new baseline is higher (or lower)
than the previous one. One solution is to allow passage of a long enough time

## Page 379

period, in which you might expect regression to happen, before evaluating the
results. In some cases, this will be a few days; in others, it might be a few weeks
or months.
When there are many changes, or the experiment comes in a series such as email
or physical mail campaigns, figuring out whether the entire program makes a
difference can be a challenge. It’s easy to claim success when customers
receiving a certain email variant purchase a product, but how do we know if they
would have made that purchase anyway? One option is to set up a long-term
holdout. This is a group that is set up to not receive any marketing messages or
changes to the product experience. Note that this is different from simply
comparing to users who have opted out of marketing messages, since there is
usually some bias in who opts out and who doesn’t. Setting up long-term
holdouts can be complicated, but there are few better ways to truly measure the
cumulative effects of campaigns and product changes.
Another option is to perform cohort analysis (discussed in Chapter 4) on the
variants. The groups can be followed for a longer time period, from weeks to
months. Retention or cumulative metrics can be calculated and tested to see
whether effects differ between variants over the long term.
Even with the various challenges that can be encountered with experiments, they
are still the best way to test and prove the causality around changes made to
experiences ranging from marketing messaging and creative to in-product
experience. We often encounter less than ideal situations in data analysis,
however, so next we’ll turn to some analysis options for when A/B testing isn’t
possible.
When Controlled Experiments Aren’t Possible:
Alternative Analyses
Randomized experiments are the gold standard for going beyond correlation to
establish causality. However, there are a number of reasons why a randomized
experiment may not be possible. It may be unethical to give different treatments
to different groups, particularly in medical or educational settings. Regulatory
requirements may prevent experiments in other settings, such as financial
services. There may be practical reasons, such as the difficulty of restricting

## Page 380

access to a variant treatment to only a randomized group. It’s always worth
considering whether there are pieces that are worth testing or are testable within
ethical, regulatory, and practical boundaries. Wording, placement, and other
design elements are some examples.
A second situation in which experimentation isn’t possible is when a change
happened in the past and the data has already been collected. Aside from
reverting the change, going back and running an experiment isn’t an option.
Sometimes a data analyst or data scientist wasn’t available to advise on
experimentation. More than once, I have joined an organization and been asked
to untangle the results of changes that would have been much more
straightforward to understand had there been a holdout group. At other times, the
change is unintended. Examples include site outages that affect some or all
customers, errors in forms, and natural disasters such as storms, earthquakes, and
wildfires.
Although causal conclusions aren’t as strong in situations in which there was no
experiment, there are a few quasi-experimental analysis methods that can be
used to draw insights from the data. These rely on constructing groups from the
available data that represent “control” and “treatment” conditions as closely as
possible.
Pre-/Post-Analysis
A pre-/post-analysis compares either the same or similar populations before and
after a change. The measurement of the population before the change is used as
the control, while the measurement after the change is used as the variant or
treatment.
Pre-/post-analysis works best when there is a clearly defined change that
happened on a well-known date, so that the before and after groups can be
cleanly divided. In this type of analysis, you will need to choose how long to
measure before and after the change, but the periods should be equal or close to
equal. For example, if two weeks have elapsed since a change, compare that
period to the two weeks prior to the change. Consider comparing multiple
periods, such as one week, two weeks, three weeks, and four weeks before and
after the change. If the results agree across all these windows, you can have
more confidence in the result than you would if the results differed.

## Page 381

Let’s walk through an example. Imagine that the onboarding flow for our mobile
game includes a step in which the user can check a box to indicate whether they
want to receive emails with game news. This had always been checked by
default, but a new regulation requires that it now be unchecked by default. On
January 27, 2020, the change was released into the game, and we would like to
find out if it had a negative effect on email opt-in rates. To do this, we will
compare the two weeks before the change to the two weeks after the change and
see whether the opt-in rate is statistically significantly different. We could use
one-week or three-week periods, but two weeks is chosen because it is long
enough to allow for some day-of-week variability and also short enough to
restrict the number of other factors that could otherwise affect users’ willingness
to opt in.
The variants are assigned in the SQL query via a CASE statement: the users who
were created in the time range prior to the change are labeled “pre,” while those
created after the change are labeled “post.” Next, we count the number of users
in each group from the game_users table. Then we count the number of
users who opted in, which is accomplished with a LEFT JOIN to the
game_actions table, restricting to the records with the “email_optin” action.
Then we divide the values to find the percent who opted in. I like to include the
count of days in each variant as a quality check, though it is not necessary to
perform the rest of the analysis:
SELECT 
case when a.created between '2020-01-13' and '2020-01-26' then 'pre'
     when a.created between '2020-01-27' and '2020-02-09' then 'post'
     end as variant
,count(distinct a.user_id) as cohorted
,count(distinct b.user_id) as opted_in
,count(distinct b.user_id) / count(distinct a.user_id) as pct_optin
,count(distinct a.created) as days
FROM game_users a
LEFT JOIN game_actions b on a.user_id = b.user_id 
 and b.action = 'email_optin'
WHERE a.created between '2020-01-13' and '2020-02-09'
GROUP BY 1
;
variant  cohorted  opted_in  pct_optin  days
-------  --------  --------  ---------  ----
pre      24662     14489     0.5875     14

## Page 382

post     27617     11220     0.4063     14
TIP
Many databases will recognize dates entered as strings, as in '2020-01-13'. If your
database does not, cast the string to a date using one of these options:
cast('2020-01-13' as date)
date('2020-01-13')
'2020-01-13'::date
In this case, we can see that the users who went through the onboarding flow
before the change had a much higher email opt-in rate—58.75%, compared to
40.63% afterward. Plugging the values into an online calculator results in
confirmation that the rate for the “pre” group is statistically significantly higher
than the rate for the “post” group. In this example, there may not be much the
game company can do, since the change is due to a regulation. Further tests
could determine whether providing sample content or other information about
the email program might encourage more new players to opt in, if this is a
business goal.
When performing a pre-/post-analysis, keep in mind that other factors beyond
the change that you’re trying to learn about may cause an increase or a decrease
in the metric. External events, seasonality, marketing promotions, and so on can
drastically change the environment and customers’ mindsets even within the
span of a few weeks. As a result, this type of analysis is not as good as a true
randomized experiment for proving causality. However, sometimes this is one of
the few analysis options available, and it can generate working hypotheses that
can be tested and refined in future controlled experiments.
Natural Experiment Analysis
A natural experiment occurs when entities end up with different experiences
through some process that approximates randomness. One group receives the
normal or control experience, and another receives some variation that may have

## Page 383

a positive or negative effect. Usually these are unintentional, such as when a
software bug is introduced, or when an event happens in one location but not in
other locations. For this type of analysis to have validity, we must be able to
clearly determine which entities were exposed. Additionally, a control group that
is as similar as possible to the exposed group is needed.
SQL can be used to construct the variants and to calculate the size of cohorts and
success events in the case of a binary outcome event (or the mean, standard
deviation, and population sizes in the case of a continuous outcome event). The
results can be plugged into an online calculator just like with any other
experiment.
As an example in the video game data set, imagine that, during the time period
of our data, users in Canada were accidentally given a different offer on the
virtual currency purchase page the first time they looked at it: an extra zero was
added to the number of virtual coins in each package. So, for example, instead of
10 coins the user would receive 100 game coins, or instead of 100 coins they
would receive 1,000 game coins, and so on. The question we would like to
answer is whether Canadians converted to buyers at a higher rate than other
users. Rather than compare to the entire user base, we will compare only to users
in the United States. The countries are close geographically, and most users in
the two countries speak the same language—and for the sake of the example,
we’ll assume that we’ve done other analysis showing that their behavior is
similar, while the behavior of users in other countries differs enough to exclude
them.
To perform the analysis, we create the “variants” from whatever the
distinguishing characteristic is—in this case, the country field from the
game_users table—but note that sometimes more complex SQL will be
required, depending on the data set. The counts of users cohorted, and those who
purchased, are calculated in the same way we saw previously:
SELECT a.country
,count(distinct a.user_id) as total_cohorted
,count(distinct b.user_id) as purchasers
,count(distinct b.user_id) / count(distinct a.user_id) 
 as pct_purchased
FROM game_users a
LEFT JOIN game_purchases b on a.user_id = b.user_id

## Page 384

WHERE a.country in ('United States','Canada')
GROUP BY 1
;
country        total_cohorted  purchasers  pct_purchased
-------------  --------------  ----------  -------------  
Canada         20179           5011        0.2483
United States  45012           4958        0.1101
The share of users in Canada who purchased is in fact higher—24.83%,
compared to 11.01% of those in the United States. Plugging these values into an
online calculator confirms that the conversion rate in Canada is statistically
significantly higher at a 95% confidence interval.
The hardest part of analyzing a natural experiment tends to be finding a
comparable population and showing that the two populations are similar enough
to support the conclusions from the statistical test. Although it is virtually
impossible to prove that there are no confounding factors, careful comparison of
population demographics and behaviors lends credibility to the results. Since a
natural experiment is not a true random experiment, the evidence for causality is
weaker, and this should be noted in the presentation of analysis of this type.
Analysis of Populations Around a Threshold
In some cases, there is a threshold value that results in some people or other
subject units getting a treatment, while others do not. For example, a certain
grade point average might qualify students for a scholarship, a certain income
level might qualify households for subsidized health care, or a high churn risk
score might trigger a sales rep to follow up with a customer. In such cases, we
can leverage the idea that subjects on either side of the threshold value are likely
quite similar to each other. So instead of comparing the entire populations that
did and did not receive the reward or intervention, we can compare only those
that were close to the threshold both on the positive and the negative side. The
formal name for this is regression discontinuity design (RDD).
To perform this type of analysis, we can construct “variants” by splitting the data
around the threshold value, similar to what we did in the pre-/post-analysis.
Unfortunately, there is no hard-and-fast rule about how wide to make the bands
of values on either side of the threshold. The “variants” should be similar in size,

## Page 385

and they should be large enough to allow for significance in the results analysis.
One option is to perform the analysis several times with a few different ranges.
For example, you might analyze the differences between the “treated” group and
the control when each group contains subjects that fall within 5%, 7.5%, and
10% of the threshold. If the conclusions from these analyses agree, there is more
support for the conclusions. If they do not agree, however, the data may be
considered inconclusive.
As with other types of nonexperimental analysis, results from RDD should be
taken as proving causality less conclusively. Potential confounding factors
should receive careful attention as well. For example, if customers with high
churn risk receive interventions from multiple teams, or a special discount to
encourage them to retain, in addition to a call from a sales rep, the data can
potentially be tainted by those other changes.
Conclusion
Experiment analysis is a rich field that often incorporates different types of
analysis seen in other parts of this book, from anomaly detection to cohort
analysis. Data profiling can be useful in tracking down issues that occur. When
randomized experiments are not possible, a variety of other techniques are
available, and SQL can be used to create synthetic control and variant groups.
In the next chapter, we’ll turn to constructing complex data sets for analysis, an
area that brings together various topics that we’ve discussed in the book so far.

Chapter 8. Creating Complex Data
Sets for Analysis
In Chapters 3 through 7, we looked at a number of ways in which SQL can be
used to perform analysis on data in databases. In addition to these specific use
cases, sometimes the goal of a query is to assemble a data set that is specific yet
general-purpose enough that it can be used to perform a variety of further
analyses. The destination might be a database table, a text file, or a business
intelligence tool. The SQL that is needed might be simple, requiring only a few
filters or aggregations. Often, however, the code or logic needed to achieve the
desired data set can become very complex. Additionally, such code is likely to be
updated over time, as stakeholders request additional data points or calculations.
The organization, performance, and maintainability of your SQL code become
critical in a way that isn’t the case for one-time analyses.
In this chapter, I’ll discuss principles for organizing code so that it’s easier to
share and update. Then I’ll discuss when to keep query logic in the SQL and
when to consider moving to permanent tables via ETL (extract-transform-load)
code. Next, I’ll explain the options for storing intermediate results—subqueries,
temp tables, and common table expressions (CTEs)—and considerations for
using them in your code. Finally, I’ll wrap up with a look at techniques for
reducing data set size and ideas for handling data privacy and removing
personally identifiable information (PII).
When to Use SQL for Complex Data Sets
Almost all data sets prepared for further analysis contain some logic. The logic
can range from the relatively simple—such as how tables are JOINed together
and how filters are placed in the WHERE clause—to complex calculations that
aggregate, categorize, parse, or perform window functions over partitions of the
data. When creating data sets for further analysis, choosing whether to keep the
logic within the SQL query or to push it upstream to an ETL job or downstream
to another tool is often as much art as science. Convenience, performance, and

## Page 387

availability of help from engineers all factor into the decision. There is often no
single right answer, but you will develop intuition and confidence the longer you
work with SQL.
Advantages of Using SQL
SQL is a very flexible language. Hopefully I convinced you in the earlier
chapters that a wide variety of data preparation and analysis tasks can be
accomplished using SQL. This flexibility is the main advantage of using SQL
when developing complex data sets.
In the initial stages of working with a data set, you may execute many queries.
Work often starts with several profiling queries to understand the data. This is
followed by building up the query step-by-step, checking transformations and
aggregations along the way to be sure that the results returned are correct. This
may be interspersed with more profiling, when actual values turn out to differ
from our expectations. Complex data sets may be built up by combining several
subqueries that answer specific questions with JOINs or UNIONs. Running a
query and examining the output is fast and allows for rapid iteration.
Aside from relying on the quality and timeliness of the data in the tables, SQL
has few dependencies. Queries are run on demand and don’t rely on a data
engineer or a release process. Queries can often be embedded into business
intelligence (BI) tools or into R or Python code by the analyst or data scientist,
without requesting technical support. When a stakeholder needs another attribute
or aggregation added to the output, changes can be made quickly.
Keeping logic in the SQL code itself is ideal when working on a new analysis
and when you expect the logic and result set to undergo changes frequently.
Additionally, when the query is fast and data is returned to stakeholders quickly,
there may never be a need to move the logic anywhere else.
When to Build into ETL Instead
There are times when moving logic into an ETL process is a better choice than
keeping all of it in a SQL query, especially when working in an organization that
has a data warehouse or data lake. The two main reasons to use ETL are
performance and visibility.

## Page 388

Performance of SQL queries depends on the complexity of the logic, the size of
the tables queried, and the computational resources of the underlying database.
Although many queries run fast, particularly on the newer databases and
hardware, you will inevitably end up writing some queries that have complex
calculations, involve JOINs of large tables or Cartesian JOINs, or otherwise
cause query time to slow down to minutes or longer. An analyst or a data
scientist may be willing to wait for a query to return. However, most consumers
of data are used to websites’ rapid response times and will get frustrated if they
have to wait more than a few seconds for data.
ETL runs behind the scenes at scheduled times and writes the result to a table.
Since it is behind the scenes, it can run for 30 seconds, five minutes, or an hour,
and end users will not be affected. Schedules are often daily but can be set to
shorter intervals. End users can query the resulting table directly, without need
for JOINs or other logic, and thus experience fast query times.
A good example of when ETL is often a better choice than keeping all of the
logic in a SQL query is the daily snapshot table. In many organizations, keeping
a daily snapshot of customers, orders, or other entities is useful for answering
analytical questions. For customers, we might want to calculate total orders or
visits to date, current status in a sales pipeline, and other attributes that either
change or accumulate. We’ve seen how to create daily series, including for days
when an entity was not present, in the discussions of time series analysis in
Chapter 3 and cohort analysis in Chapter 4. At the individual entity level, and
over long time periods, such queries can become slow. Additionally, attributes
such as current status may be overwritten in the source table, so capturing a daily
snapshot may be the only way to preserve an accurate picture of history.
Developing the ETL and storing daily snapshot results in a table are often worth
the effort.
Visibility is a second reason to move logic into ETL. Often SQL queries exist on
an individual’s computer or are buried within report code. It can be difficult for
others to even find the logic embedded in the query, let alone understand and
check it for mistakes. Moving logic into ETL and storing the ETL code in a
repository such as GitHub makes it easier for others in an organization to find,
check, and iterate on it. Most repositories used by development teams also store
change history, an additional benefit that allows you to see when a particular line

## Page 389

in a query was added or changed.
There are good reasons to consider putting logic into ETL, but this approach also
has its drawbacks. One is that fresh results are not available until the ETL job
has run and refreshed the data, even if new data has arrived in the underlying
table. This can be overcome by continuing to run SQL against the raw data for
very new records but limiting it to a small time window so that the query runs
quickly. This can optionally be combined with a query on the ETL table, using
subqueries or UNION. Another drawback to placing logic in ETL is that it
becomes harder to change. Updates or bug fixes often need to be handed to a
data engineer and code tested, checked into the repository, and released into the
production data warehouse. For this reason, I usually opt to wait until my SQL
queries are past the period of rapid iteration, and the resulting data sets have
been reviewed and are in use by the organization, before moving them into ETL.
Of course, making code harder to change and enforcing code reviews are
excellent ways to ensure consistency and data quality.
VIEWS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ETL
When you want the reusability and code visibility of ETL but without
actually storing the results and therefore taking up space permanently, a
database view can be a good option. A view is essentially a saved query with
a permanent alias that can be referenced just like any other table in the
database. The query can be simple or complex and may involve table joins,
filters, and any other elements of SQL.
Views can be used to ensure that everyone querying the data uses the same
definitions, as defined in the underlying query—for example, by always
filtering out test transactions. They can be used to shield users from the
complexity of the underlying logic, helpful for more novice or occasional
users of a database. Views can also be used to provide an extra layer of
security by restricting access to certain rows or columns in a database. For
example, a view might be created to exclude PII such as email addresses but
allow query writers to view other acceptable customer attributes.
Views have a few drawbacks, however. They are objects in the database and
thus require permissions to create and update their definitions. Views do not
store the data, so each time a query is run with a view, the database must go

## Page 390

back to the underlying table or tables to fetch the data. As a result, they are
not a replacement for ETL that creates a precomputed table of data.
Most major databases also have materialized views, which are similar to
views but do store the returned data in a table. Planning for the creation and
refreshing of materialized views is usually best done in consultation with an
experienced database administrator, as there are nuanced performance
considerations beyond the scope of this book.
When to Put Logic in Other Tools
SQL code and the query results output in your query editor are frequently only
part of an analysis. Results are often embedded in reports, visualized into tables
and graphs, or further manipulated in a range of tools, from spreadsheets and BI
software to environments in which statistical or machine learning code is
applied. In addition to choosing when to move logic upstream into ETL, we also
have choices about when to move logic downstream into other tools. Both
performance and specific use cases are key factors in the decision.
Each type of tool has performance strengths and limitations. Spreadsheets are
very flexible but are not known for being able to handle large numbers of rows
or complex calculations across many rows. Databases definitely have a
performance advantage, so it’s often best to perform as much of the calculation
as possible in the database and pass the smallest data set possible on to the
spreadsheet.
BI tools have a range of capabilities, so it’s important to understand both how
the software handles calculations and how the data will be used. Some BI tools
can cache data (keep a local copy) in an optimized format, speeding up
calculations. Others issue a new query each time a field is added to or removed
from a report and thus mainly leverage the computational power of the database.
Certain calculations such as count distinct and median require detailed,
entity-level data. If it’s not possible to anticipate all the variations on these
calculations in advance, it may be necessary to pass a larger, more detailed data
set than otherwise might be ideal. Additionally, if the goal is to create a data set
that allows exploration and slicing in many different ways, more detail is usually
better. Figuring out the best combination of SQL, ETL, and BI tool computation

## Page 391

can take some iteration.
When the goal is to perform statistical or machine learning analysis on the data
set using a language such as R or Python, detailed data is usually better. Both of
these languages can perform tasks that overlap with SQL, such as aggregation
and text manipulation. It’s often best to perform as much of the calculation as
possible in SQL, to leverage the computational power of the database, but no
more. Flexibility to iterate is usually an important part of the modeling process.
The choice of whether to perform calculations in SQL or another language may
also depend on your familiarity and comfort level with each. Those who are very
comfortable in SQL may prefer to do more calculations in the database, while
those who are more proficient in R or Python may prefer to do more calculations
there.
TIP
Although there are few rules to deciding where to put logic, I will encourage you to follow one
rule in particular: avoid manual steps. It’s easy enough to open a data set in a spreadsheet or
text editor, make a small change, save, and move on. But when you need to iterate, or when
new data arrives, it’s easy to forget that manual step or to perform it inconsistently. In my
experience, there’s no such thing as a truly “one-off” request. Put logic into code somewhere,
if at all possible.
SQL is a great tool and is incredibly flexible. It also sits within the analysis
workflow and within an ecosystem of tools. Deciding where to put calculations
can take some trial and error as you iterate through what is feasible among SQL,
ETL, and downstream tools. The more familiarity and experience you have with
all the available options, the better you will be able to estimate trade-offs and
continue to improve the performance and flexibility of your work.
Code Organization
SQL has few formatting rules, which can lead to unruly queries. Query clauses
must be in the correct order: SELECT is followed by FROM, and GROUP BY
cannot precede WHERE, for example. A few keywords such as SELECT and
FROM are reserved (i.e., they cannot be used as field names, table names, or

## Page 392

aliases). However, unlike in some other languages, newlines, whitespace (other
than the spaces that separate words), and capitalization are not important and are
ignored by the database. Any of the example queries in this book could have
been written on a single line, and with or without capital letters, except in quoted
strings. As a result, the burden of code organization is on the person writing the
query. Fortunately, we have some formal and informal tools for keeping code
organized, from commenting to “cosmetic” formatting such as indentation and
storage options for files of SQL code.
Commenting
Most coding languages have a way to indicate that a block of text should be
treated as a comment and ignored during execution. SQL has two options. The
first is to use two dash marks, which turns everything on the line that follows
into a comment:
-- This is a comment
The second option is to use the slash (/) and star (*) characters to start a
comment block, which can extend over multiple lines, followed by a star and
slash to end the comment block:
/*
This is a comment block
with multiple lines
*/
Many SQL editors adjust the visual style of code inside comments, by graying
them out or otherwise changing the color, to make them easier to spot.
Commenting code is a good practice, but admittedly it’s one that many people
struggle to do on a regular basis. SQL is often written quickly, and especially
during exploration or profiling exercises, we don’t expect to keep our code for
the long term. Overly commented code can be just as difficult to read as code
with no comments. And we all suffer from the idea that since we wrote the code,
we will always be able to remember why we wrote the code. However, anyone
who has inherited a long query written by a colleague or has stepped away from
a query for a few months and then come back to update it will know that it can

## Page 393

be frustrating and time consuming to decipher the code.
To balance the burden and the benefit of commenting, I try to follow a few rules
of thumb. First, add a comment anywhere that a value has a nonobvious
meaning. Many source systems will encode values as integers, and their meaning
is easy to forget. Leaving a note makes the meaning clear and makes the code
easier to change if needed:
WHERE status in (1,2) -- 1 is Active, 2 is Pending
Second, comment on any other nonobvious calculations or transformations.
These can be anything that someone who hasn’t spent the time profiling the data
set might not know, from data entry errors to the existence of outliers:
case when status = 'Live' then 'Active'
     else status end
     /* we used to call customers Live but in
     2020 we switched it to Active */
The third practice I try to follow around commenting is to leave notes when the
query contains multiple subqueries. A quick line about what each subquery
calculates makes it easy to skip to the relevant piece when coming back later to
quality check or edit a longer query:
SELECT...
FROM
( -- find the first date for each customer
    SELECT ...
    FROM ...
) a
JOIN 
( -- find all of the products for each customer
    SELECT ...
    FROM ...
) b on a.field = b.field
...
;
Commenting well takes practice and some discipline, but it’s worth doing for
most queries that are longer than a few lines. Commenting can also be used to
add useful information to the overall query, such as purpose, author, date created,

## Page 394

and so on. Be kind to your colleagues, and to your future self, by placing helpful
comments in your code. 
Capitalization, Indentation, Parentheses, and Other
Formatting Tricks
Formatting, and consistent formatting especially, is a good way to keep SQL
code organized and legible. Databases ignore capitalization and whitespace
(spaces, tabs, and newlines) in SQL, so we can use these to our advantage to
format code into more legible blocks. Parentheses can both control the order of
execution, which we will discuss more later, and also visually group calculation
elements.
Capitalized words stand out from the rest, as anyone who has received an email
with an all-caps subject line can confirm. I like to use capitalization only for the
main clauses: SELECT, FROM, JOIN, WHERE, and so on. Particularly in long
or complex queries, being able to spot these quickly and thus to understand
where the SELECT clause ends and the FROM clause begins saves me a lot of
time.
Whitespace is another key way to organize and make parts of the query easier to
find, and to understand which parts logically go together. Any SQL query could
be written on a single line in the editor, but in most cases this would lead to a lot
of scrolling left and right through code. I like to start each clause (SELECT,
FROM, etc.) on a new line, which, along with capitalization, helps me keep track
of where each one starts and ends. Additionally, I find that putting aggregations
on their own lines, as well as functions that take up some space, helps with
organization. For CASE statements with more than two WHEN conditions,
separating them onto multiple lines is also a good way to easily see and keep
track of what is happening in the code. As an example, we can query the type
and mag (magnitude), parse place, and then count the records in the
earthquakes table, with some filtering in the WHERE clause:
SELECT type, mag
,case when place like '%CA%' then 'California'
      when place like '%AK%' then 'Alaska'
      else trim(split_part(place,',',2)) 
      end as place
,count(*)

## Page 395

FROM earthquakes
WHERE date_part('year',time) >= 2019
and mag between 0 and 1
GROUP BY 1,2,3
;
type                mag  place       count
------------------  ---  ----------  -----
chemical explosion  0    California  1
earthquake          0    Alaska      160
earthquake          0    Argentina   1
...                 ...  ...         ...
Indentation is another trick for keeping code visually organized. Adding spaces
or tabs to line up the WHEN items within a CASE statement is one example.
You’ve also seen subqueries indented in examples throughout the book. This
makes subqueries visually stand apart, and when a query has multiple levels of
nested subqueries, it makes it easier to see and understand the order in which
they will be evaluated and which subqueries are peers in terms of level:
SELECT... 
FROM 
(
    SELECT...
    FROM
    (
        SELECT...
        FROM...
    ) a
    JOIN
    (
        SELECT...
        FROM
    ) b on...
) a
...
;
Any number of other formatting choices can be made, and the query will return
the same results. Long-term SQL writers tend to have their own formatting
preferences. However, clear and consistent formatting makes creating,
maintaining, and sharing SQL code much easier.
Many SQL query editors provide some form of query formatting and coloration.

## Page 396

Usually keywords are colored, making them easier to spot within a query. These
visual clues make both developing and reviewing SQL queries much easier. If
you’ve been writing SQL in a query editor all along, try opening a .sql file in a
plain text editor to see the difference coloration makes. Figure 8-1 shows an
example of a SQL query editor, and the same code is shown in a plain text editor
in Figure 8-2 (please note that these may appear in grayscale in some versions of
this book).

Figure 8-2. The same code as plain text in the text editor Atom

## Page 397

Formatting is optional from the database perspective, but it’s a good practice.
Consistent use of spacing, capitalization, and other formatting options goes a
long way toward keeping your code readable, therefore making it easier to share
and maintain.
Storing Code
After going to the trouble of commenting and formatting code, it’s a good idea to
store it somewhere in case you need to use or reference it later.
Many data analysts and scientists work with a SQL editor, often a desktop piece
of software. SQL editors are useful because they usually include tools for
browsing the database schema alongside a code window. They save files with a
.sql extension, and these text files can be opened and changed in any text editor.
Files can be saved in local directories or in cloud-based file storage services.
Since they are text, SQL code files are easy to store in change control
repositories such as GitHub. Using a repository provides a nice backup option
and makes for easy sharing with others. Repositories also track the change
history of files, which is useful when you need to figure out when a particular
change was made, or when the change history is required for regulatory reasons.
The main drawback of GitHub and other tools is that they are usually not a
required step in the analysis workflow. You need to remember to update your
code periodically, and as with any manual step, it’s easy to forget to do it.
Organizing Computations
Two related problems we face when creating complex data sets are getting the
logic right and getting good query performance. Logic must be correct, or the
results will be meaningless. Query performance for analysis purposes, unlike for
transactional systems, usually has a range of “good enough.” Queries that don’t
return are problematic, but the difference between waiting 30 seconds and
waiting a minute for results may not matter a great deal. With SQL, there is often
more than one way to write a query that returns the correct results. We can use
this to our advantage to both ensure correct logic and tune performance of long-
running queries. There are three main ways to organize the calculation of
intermediate results in SQL: the subquery, temp tables, and common table

## Page 398

expressions (CTEs). Before we dive into them, we’ll review the order of
evaluation in SQL. To wrap up the section, I’ll introduce grouping sets,
which can replace the need to UNION queries together in certain cases.
Understanding Order of SQL Clause Evaluation
Databases translate SQL code into a set of operations that will be carried out in
order to return the requested data. While understanding exactly how this happens
isn’t necessary to be good at writing SQL for analysis, understanding the order
in which the database will perform its operations is incredibly useful (and is
sometimes necessary to debug unexpected results).
TIP
Many modern databases have sophisticated query optimizers that consider various parts of the
query to come up with the most efficient plan for execution. Although they may consider parts
of the query in a different order from that discussed here and therefore may need less query
optimization from humans, they won’t calculate intermediate results in a different order from
that discussed here.
The general order of evaluation is shown in Table 8-1. SQL queries usually
include only a subset of possible clauses, so actual evaluation includes only the
steps relevant to the query.
Table 8-1. SQL query order of evaluation

including JOINs and their ON clauses

WHERE

GROUP BY
 
 
 
including aggregations

HAVING

Window functions

SELECT

DISTINCT

## Page 399

UNION

ORDER BY

LIMIT and OFFSET
First the tables in the FROM clause are evaluated, along with any JOINs. If the
FROM clause includes any subqueries, these are evaluated before proceeding to
the rest of the steps. In a JOIN, the ON clause specifies how the tables are to be
JOINed, which may also filter the result set.
TIP
FROM is always evaluated first, with one exception: when the query doesn’t contain a FROM
clause. In most databases, it’s possible to query using only a SELECT clause, as seen in some
of the examples in this book. A SELECT-only query can return system information such as the
date and database version. It can also apply mathematical, date, text, and other functions to
constants. While there is admittedly little use for such queries in final analyses, they are handy
for testing out functions or iterating over tricky calculations rapidly.
Next, the WHERE clause is evaluated to determine which records should be
included in further calculations. Note that WHERE falls early in the order of
evaluation and so cannot include the results of calculations that happen in a later
step.
GROUP BY is calculated next, including the related aggregations such as
count, sum, and avg. As you might expect, GROUP BY will include only the
values that exist in the FROM tables after any JOINing and filtering in the
WHERE clause.
HAVING is evaluated next. Since it follows GROUP BY, HAVING can perform
filtering on aggregated values returned by GROUP BY. The only other way to
filter by aggregated values is to place the query in a subquery and apply the
filters in the main query. For example, we might want to find all the states that
have at least one thousand terms in the legislators_terms table, and we’ll
order by terms in descending order for good measure:
SELECT state
,count(*) as terms
FROM legislators_terms

## Page 400

GROUP BY 1
HAVING count(*) >= 1000
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
state  terms
-----  -----
NY     4159
PA     3252
OH     2239
...    ...
Window functions, if used, are evaluated next. Interestingly, since aggregates
have already been calculated at this point, they can be used in the window
function definition. For example, in the legislators data set from Chapter 4,
we could calculate both the terms served per state and the average terms across
all states in a single query:
SELECT state
,count(*) as terms
,avg(count(*)) over () as avg_terms
FROM legislators_terms
GROUP BY 1
;
state  terms  avg_terms
-----  -----  ---------
ND     170    746.830
NV     177    746.830
OH     2239   746.830
...    ...    ...
Aggregates can also be used in the OVER clause, as in the following query that
ranks the states in descending order by the total number of terms:
SELECT state
,count(*) as terms
,rank() over (order by count(*) desc)
FROM legislators_terms
GROUP BY 1
;
state  terms  rank
-----  -----  ----
NY     4159   1

## Page 401

PA     3252   2
OH     2239   3
...    ...    ...
At this point, the SELECT clause is finally evaluated. This is a little
counterintuitive since aggregations and window functions are typed in the
SELECT section of the query. However, the database has already taken care of
the calculations, and the results are then available for further manipulation or for
display as is. For example, an aggregation can be placed within a CASE
statement and have mathematical, date, or text functions applied if the result of
the aggregation is one of those data types.
TIP
The aggregators sum, count, and avg return numeric values. However, min and max
functions return the same data type as the input and use the inherent ordering of that data type.
For example, min and max dates return the earliest and latest calendar dates, while min and
max on text fields use alphabetical order to determine the result.
Following SELECT is DISTINCT, if present in the query. This means that all the
rows are calculated and then deduplication occurs.
UNION (or UNION ALL) is performed next. Up to this point, each query that
makes up a UNION is evaluated independently. This stage is when the result sets
are assembled together into one. This means that the queries can go about their
calculations in very different ways or from different data sets. All UNION looks
for is the same number of columns and for those columns to have compatible
data types.
ORDER BY is almost the last step in evaluation. This means that it can access
any of the prior calculations to sort the result set. The only caveat is that if
DISTINCT is used, ORDER BY cannot include any fields that are not returned in
the SELECT clause. Otherwise, it is entirely possible to order a result set by a
field that doesn’t otherwise appear in the query.
LIMIT and OFFSET are evaluated last in the query execution sequence. This
ensures that the subset of results returned will have fully calculated results as
specified by any of the other clauses that are in the query. This also means that

## Page 402

LIMIT has somewhat limited use in controlling the amount of work the database
does before the results are returned to you. This is perhaps most noticeable when
a query contains a large OFFSET value. In order to OFFSET by, say, three
million records, the database still needs to calculate the entire result set, figure
out where the three millionth plus one record is, and then return the records
specified by the LIMIT. This doesn’t mean LIMIT isn’t useful. Checking a few
results can confirm calculations without overwhelming the network or your local
machine with data. Also, using LIMIT as early in a query as possible, such as in
a subquery, can still dramatically reduce the work required by the database as
you develop a more complex query.
Now that we have a good understanding of the order in which databases evaluate
queries and perform calculations, we’ll turn to some options for controlling these
operations in the context of a larger, complex query: subqueries, temporary
tables, and CTEs.
Subqueries
Subqueries are usually the first way we learn how to control the order of
evaluation in SQL, or to accomplish calculations that can’t be achieved in a
single main query. They are versatile and can help organize long queries into
smaller chunks with discrete purposes.
A subquery is enclosed in parentheses, a notation that should be familiar from
mathematics, where parentheses also force evaluation of some part of an
equation prior to the rest. Within the parentheses is a standalone query that is
evaluated before the main outer query. Assuming the subquery is in the FROM
clause, the result set can then be queried by the main code, just like any other
table. We’ve already seen many examples with subqueries in this book.
An exception to the standalone nature of a subquery is a special type called a
lateral subquery, which can access results from previous items in the FROM
clause. A comma and the keyword LATERAL are used instead of JOIN, and there
is no ON clause. Instead, a prior query is used inside the subquery. As an
example, imagine we wanted to analyze previous party membership for currently
sitting legislators. We could find the first year they were a member of a different
party, and check how common that is when grouped by their current party. In the
first subquery, we find the currently sitting legislators. In the second, lateral

## Page 403

subquery, we use the results from the first subquery to return the earliest
term_start where the party is different from the current party:
SELECT date_part('year',c.first_term) as first_year
,a.party
,count(a.id_bioguide) as legislators
FROM
(
    SELECT distinct id_bioguide, party
    FROM legislators_terms
    WHERE term_end > '2020-06-01'
) a,
LATERAL
(
    SELECT b.id_bioguide
    ,min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms b
    WHERE b.id_bioguide = a.id_bioguide
    and b.party <> a.party
    GROUP BY 1
) c
GROUP BY 1,2
;
first_year  party        legislators
----------  ----------   -----------
1979.0      Republican   1
2011.0      Libertarian  1
2015.0      Democrat     1
This turns out to be fairly uncommon. Only three current legislators have
switched parties, and no party has had more switchers than other parties. There
are other ways to return the same result—for example, by changing the query to
a JOIN and moving the criteria in the WHERE clause of the second subquery to
the ON clause:
SELECT date_part('year',c.first_term) as first_year
,a.party
,count(a.id_bioguide) as legislators
FROM
(
    SELECT distinct id_bioguide, party
    FROM legislators_terms
    WHERE term_end > '2020-06-01'
) a
JOIN

## Page 404

(
    SELECT id_bioguide, party
    ,min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms
    GROUP BY 1,2
) c on c.id_bioguide = a.id_bioguide and c.party <> a.party
GROUP BY 1,2
;
If the second table is very large, filtering by a value returned in a previous
subquery can speed up execution. In my experience, use of LATERAL is less
common, and therefore less well understood, than other syntax, so it’s good to
reserve it for use cases that can’t be solved efficiently another way.
Subqueries allow a lot of flexibility and control over the order of calculations.
However, a complex series of calculations in the middle of a larger query can
become difficult to understand and maintain. At other times, the performance of
subqueries is too slow, or the query won’t return results at all. Fortunately, SQL
has some additional options that may help in these situations: temporary tables
and common table expressions.
Temporary Tables
A temporary (temp) table is created in a similar way to any other table in the
database, but with a key difference: it persists only for the duration of the current
session. Temp tables are useful when you are working with only a small part of a
very large table, as small tables are much faster to query. They are also useful
when you want to use an intermediate result in multiple queries. Since the temp
table is a standalone table, it can be queried many times within the same session.
Yet another time they are useful is when you are working in certain databases,
such as Redshift or Vertica, that partition data across nodes. INSERTing data into
a temp table can align the partitioning to other tables that will be JOINed
together in a subsequent query. There are two main drawbacks to temp tables.
First, they require database privileges to write data, which may not be allowed
for security reasons. Second, some BI tools, such as Tableau and Metabase,
allow only a single SQL statement to create a data set,  whereas a temp table
requires at least two: the statement to CREATE and INSERT data into the temp
table and the query using the temp table.

## Page 405

To create a temporary table, use the CREATE command, followed by the
keyword TEMPORARY and the name you wish to give it. The table can then be
defined and a second statement used to populate it, or you can use CREATE as
SELECT to create and populate in one step. For example, you could create a
temp table with the distinct states for which there have been legislators:
CREATE temporary table temp_states
(
state varchar primary key
)
;
INSERT into temp_states
SELECT distinct state
FROM legislators_terms
;
The first statement creates the table, while the second statement populates the
temp table with values from a query. Note that by defining the table first, I need
to specify the data type for all the columns (in this case varchar for the
state column) and can optionally use other elements of table definition, such
as setting a primary key. I like to prefix temp table names with “temp_” or
“tmp_” to remind myself of the fact that I’m using a temp table in the main
query, but this isn’t strictly necessary.
The faster and easier way to generate a temp table is the CREATE as SELECT
method:
CREATE temporary table temp_states
as
SELECT distinct state
FROM legislators_terms
;
In this case, the database automatically decides the data type based on the data
returned by the SELECT statement, and no primary key is set. Unless you need
fine-grained control for performance reasons, this second method will serve you
well.
Since temp tables are written to disk, if you need to repopulate them during a
session, you will have to DROP and re-create the table or TRUNCATE the data.

## Page 406

Disconnecting and reconnecting to the database also works.
Common Table Expressions
CTEs are a relative newcomer to the SQL language, having been introduced into
many of the major databases only during the early 2000s. I wrote SQL for years
without them, making do with subqueries and temp tables. I have to say that
since I became aware of them a few years ago, they have steadily grown on me.
You can think of a common table expression as being like a subquery lifted out
and placed at the beginning of the query execution. It creates a temporary result
set that can then be used anywhere in the subsequent query. A query can have
multiple CTEs, and CTEs can use results from previous CTEs to perform
additional calculations.
CTEs are particularly useful when the result will be used multiple times in the
rest of the query. The alternative, defining the same subquery multiple times, is
both slow (since the database needs to execute the same query several times) and
error-prone. Forgetting to update the logic in each identical subquery introduces
error into the final result. Since CTEs are part of a single query, they don’t
require any special database permissions. They can also be a useful way to
organize code into discrete chunks and avoid sprawling nested subqueries.
The main drawback of CTEs arises from the fact that they are defined at the
beginning, separate from where they are used. This can make a query more
difficult to decipher for others when the query is very long, as it’s necessary to
scroll to the beginning to check the definition and then back to where the CTE is
used to understand what is happening. Good use of comments can help with this.
A second challenge is that CTEs make execution of sections of long queries
more difficult. To check intermediate results in a longer query, it’s fairly easy to
select and run just a subquery in a query development tool. If a CTE is involved,
however, all of the surrounding code must be commented out first.
To create a CTE, we use the WITH keyword at the beginning of the overall
query, followed by a name for the CTE and then the query that makes it up
enclosed in parentheses. For example, we could create a CTE that calculates the
first term for each legislator and then use this result in further calculation, such
as the cohort calculation introduced in Chapter 4:

## Page 407

WITH first_term as
(
    SELECT id_bioguide
    ,min(term_start) as first_term
    FROM legislators_terms 
    GROUP BY 1
) 
SELECT date_part('year',age(b.term_start,a.first_term)) as periods
,count(distinct a.id_bioguide) as cohort_retained
FROM first_term a
JOIN legislators_terms b on a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide 
GROUP BY 1
;
periods  cohort_retained
-------  ---------------
0.0      12518
1.0      3600
2.0      3619
...      ...
The query result is exactly the same as that returned by the alternate query using
subqueries seen in Chapter 4. Multiple CTEs can be used in the same query,
separated by commas:
WITH first_cte as
(
    SELECT...
),
second_cte as
(
    SELECT...
)
SELECT...
;
CTEs are a useful way to control the order of evaluation, improve performance
in some instances, and organize your SQL code. They are easy to use once you
are familiar with the syntax, and they are available in most major databases.
There are often multiple ways to accomplish something in SQL, and although
not required, CTEs add useful flexibility to your SQL skills toolbox.
grouping sets

## Page 408

Although this next topic isn’t strictly about controlling the order of evaluation, it
is a handy way to avoid UNIONs and get the database to do all the work in a
single query statement. Within the GROUP BY clause, special syntax is available
in many major databases that includes grouping sets, cube, and rollup
(though Redshift is an exception, and MySQL only has rollup). They are
useful when the data set needs to contain subtotals for various combinations of
attributes.
For examples in this section, we’ll use a data set of video game sales that is
available on Kaggle. It contains attributes for the name of each game as well as
the platform, year, genre, and game publisher. Sales figures are provided for
North America, the EU, Japan, Other (the rest of the world), and the global total.
The table name is videogame_sales. Figure 8-3 shows a sample of the
table.
Figure 8-3. Sample of the videogame_sales table
So in the video game data set, for example, we might want to aggregate
global_sales by platform, genre, and publisher as standalone aggregations
(rather than only the combinations of the three fields that exist in the data) but

## Page 409

output the results in one query set. This can be accomplished by UNIONing
together three queries. Note that each query must contain at least placeholders
for all three of the grouping fields:
SELECT platform
,null as genre
,null as publisher
,sum(global_sales) as global_sales
FROM videogame_sales
GROUP BY 1,2,3
    UNION
SELECT null as platform
,genre
,null as publisher
,sum(global_sales) as global_sales
FROM videogame_sales
GROUP BY 1,2,3
    UNION
SELECT null as platform
,null as genre
,publisher
,sum(global_sales) as global_sales
FROM videogame_sales
GROUP BY 1,2,3
;
platform  genre      publisher        global_sales

This can be achieved in a more compact query using grouping sets. Within
the GROUP BY clause, grouping sets is followed by the list of groupings
to calculate. The previous query can be replaced by:
SELECT platform, genre, publisher
,sum(global_sales) as global_sales
FROM videogame_sales
GROUP BY grouping sets (platform, genre, publisher)

## Page 410

platform  genre      publisher        global_sales

The items inside the grouping sets parentheses can include blanks as well
as comma-separated lists of columns. As an example, we can calculate the global
sales without any grouping, in addition to the groupings by platform, genre,
and publisher, by including a list item that is just a pair of parentheses. We’ll
also clean up the output by substituting “All” for the null items using
coalesce:
SELECT coalesce(platform,'All') as platform
,coalesce(genre,'All') as genre
,coalesce(publisher,'All') as publisher
,sum(global_sales) as na_sales
FROM videogame_sales
GROUP BY grouping sets ((), platform, genre, publisher)
ORDER BY 1,2,3
;
platform  genre      publisher        global_sales

All       All        1C Company       0.10
...       ...        ...              ...
If we want to calculate all possible combinations of platform, genre, and
publisher, such as the individual subtotals just calculated, plus all combinations

## Page 411

of platform and genre, platform and publisher, and genre and publisher, we could
specify all of these combinations in the grouping sets. Or we can use the
handy cube syntax, which handles all of this for us:
SELECT coalesce(platform,'All') as platform
,coalesce(genre,'All') as genre
,coalesce(publisher,'All') as publisher
,sum(global_sales) as global_sales
FROM videogame_sales
GROUP BY cube (platform, genre, publisher)
ORDER BY 1,2,3
;
platform  genre      publisher        global_sales
--------  ------     ---------        ------------
All       All        All              8920.44
PS3       All        All              957.84
PS3       Action     All              307.88
PS3       Action     Atari            0.2
All       Action     All              1751.18
All       Action     Atari            26.65
All       All        Atari            157.22
...       ...        ...              ...
A third option is the function rollup, which returns a data set that has
combinations determined by the ordering of fields in the parentheses, rather than
all possible combinations. So the previous query with the following clause:
GROUP BY rollup (platform, genre, publisher)
returns aggregations for the combinations of:
platform, genre, publisher
platform, genre
platform
But the query does not return aggregations for the combinations of:
platform, publisher
genre,publisher
genre
publisher

## Page 412

Although it is possible to create the same output using UNION, the grouping
sets, cube, and rollup options are big space and time savers when
aggregations at multiple levels are needed, because they result in fewer lines of
code and fewer scans of the underlying database tables. I once created a query
hundreds of lines long using UNIONs to generate output for a dynamic website
graphic that needed to have all possible combinations of filters precalculated.
Quality checking it was an enormous chore, and updating it was even worse.
Leveraging grouping sets, and CTEs for that matter, could have gone a
long way toward making the code more compact and easy to write and maintain.
Managing Data Set Size and Privacy Concerns
After taking care to properly work out the logic in our SQL, organize our code,
and make it efficient, we’re often faced with another challenge: the size of the
result set. Data storage is ever cheaper, meaning that organizations are storing
ever-larger data sets. Computational power is also always increasing, allowing us
to crunch this data in the sophisticated ways we’ve seen in previous chapters.
However, bottlenecks still occur, either in downstream systems such as BI tools
or in the bandwidth available to pass large data sets between systems.
Additionally, data privacy is a major concern that impacts how we handle
sensitive data. For these reasons, in this section I’ll discuss some ways to limit
the size of data sets, as well as considerations for data privacy.
Sampling with %, mod
One way to reduce the size of a result set is to use a sample of the source data.
Sampling means taking only a subset of the data points or observations. This is
appropriate when the data set is large enough and a subset is representative of
the entire population. You can often sample website traffic and still retain most
of the useful insights, for example. There are two choices to make when
sampling. The first is the size of the sample that achieves the right balance
between reducing the size of the data set and not losing too much critical detail.
The sample might include 10%, 1%, or 0.1% of the data points, depending on
the starting volume. The second choice is the entity on which to perform the
sampling. We might sample 1% of website visits, but if the goal of the analysis is

## Page 413

to understand how users navigate the website, sampling 1% of website visitors
would be a better choice in order to preserve all the data points for the users in
the sample.
The most common way to sample is to filter query results in the WHERE clause
by applying a function to an entity-level identifier. Many ID fields are stored as
integers. If this is the case, taking a modulo is a quick way to achieve the right
result. The modulo is the whole number remainder when one number is divided
by another. For example, 10 divided by 3 is equal to 3 with a remainder
(modulo) of 1. SQL has two equivalent ways to find the modulo—with the %
sign and with the mod function:
SELECT 123456 % 100 as mod_100;
mod_100
-------

SELECT mod(123456,100) as mod_100;
mod_100
-------

Both return the same answer, 56, which is also the last two digits of the input
value 123456. To generate a 1% sample of the data set, place either syntax in
the WHERE clause and set it equal to an integer—in this case, 7:
SELECT user_id, ...
FROM table
WHERE user_id % 100 = 7
;
A mod of 100 creates a 1% sample, while a mod of 1,000 would create a 0.1%
sample, and a mod of 10 would create a 10% sample. Although sampling in
multiples of 10 is common, it’s not required, and any integer will work.
Sampling from alphanumeric identifiers that include both letters and numbers
isn’t as straightforward as sampling purely numeric identifiers. String-parsing
functions can be used to isolate just the first or last few characters, and filters can
be applied to them. For example, we can sample only identifiers ending in the

## Page 414

letter “b” by parsing the last character from a string using the right function:
SELECT user_id, ...
FROM table
WHERE right(user_id,1) = 'b'
;
Assuming that any upper- or lowercase letter or number is a possible value, this
will result in a sample of approximately 1.6% (1/62). To return a larger sample,
adjust the filter to allow multiple values:
SELECT user_id, ...
FROM table
WHERE right(user_id,1) in ('b','f','m')
;
To create a smaller sample, include multiple characters:
SELECT user_id, ...
FROM table
WHERE right(user_id,2) = 'c3'
;
TIP
When sampling, it’s worth validating that the function you use to generate a sample does create
a random or close-to-random sampling of the data. In one of my previous roles, we discovered
that certain types of users were more likely to have certain combinations of the last two digits
in their user IDs. In this case, using the mod function to generate a 1% sample resulted in
noticeable bias in the results. Alphanumeric identifiers in particular often have common
patterns at the beginning or end of the string that data profiling can help identify.
Sampling is an easy way to reduce data set size by orders of magnitude. It can
both speed up calculations within SQL statements and allow the final result to be
more compact, making it faster and easier to transfer to another tool or system.
Sometimes the loss of detail from sampling isn’t acceptable, however, and other
techniques are needed.
Reducing Dimensionality

## Page 415

The number of distinct combinations of attributes, or dimensionality, greatly
impacts the number of records in a data set. To understand this, we can do a
simple thought experiment. Imagine we have a field with 10 distinct values, and
we count the number of records and GROUP BY that field. The query will
return 10 results. Now add in a second field, also with 10 distinct values, count
the number of records, and GROUP BY the two fields. The query will return 100
results. Add in a third field with 10 distinct values, and the query result grows to
1,000 results. Even if not all the combinations of the three fields actually exist in
the table queried, it’s clear that adding additional fields into a query can increase
the size of the results dramatically.
When performing analysis, we can often control the number of fields and filter
the values included in order to end up with a manageable output. However, when
preparing data sets for further analysis in other tools, the goal is often to provide
flexibility and therefore to include many different attributes and calculations. To
retain as much detail as possible while managing the overall size of the data, we
can use one or more grouping techniques.
Granularity of dates and times is often an obvious place to look to reduce the
size of data. Talk to your stakeholders to determine whether daily data is needed,
for example, or whether weekly or monthly aggregations would work just as
well. Grouping data by month and day of week might be a solution to
aggregating data while still providing visibility into patterns that differ on
weekdays versus weekends. Restricting the length of time returned is always an
option, but that can restrict exploration of longer-term trends. I have seen data
teams provide one data set that aggregates to a monthly level and covers several
years, while a companion data set includes the same attributes but with daily or
even hourly data for a much shorter time window.
Text fields are another place to check for possible space savings. Differences in
spelling or capitalization can result in many more distinct values than are useful.
Applying text functions discussed in Chapter 5, such as lower, trim, or
initcap, standardizes values and usually makes data more useful for
stakeholders as well. REPLACE or CASE statements can be used to make more
nuanced adjustments, such as adjusting spelling or changing a name that has
been updated to a new value.
Sometimes only a few values out of a longer list are relevant for analysis, so

## Page 416

retaining detail for those while grouping the rest together is effective. I have seen
this frequently when working with geographic locations. There are close to two
hundred countries in the world, but often only a handful have enough customers
or other data points to make reporting on them individually worthwhile. The
legislators data set used in Chapter 4 contains 59 values for state, which
includes the 50 states plus US territories that have representatives. We might
want to create a data set with detail for the five states with the largest
populations (currently California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania),
and then group the rest into an “other” category with a CASE statement:
SELECT case when state in ('CA','TX','FL','NY','PA') then state 
            else 'Other' end as state_group
,count(*) as terms
FROM legislators_terms
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
state_group  count
-----------  -----
Other        31980
NY           4159
PA           3252
CA           2121
TX           1692
FL           859
The query returns only 6 rows, down from 59, which represents a significant
decrease. To make the list more dynamic, we can first rank the values in a
subquery, in this case by the distinct id_bioguide (legislator ID) values, and
then return the state value for the top 5 and “Other” for the rest:
SELECT case when b.rank <= 5 then a.state 
            else 'Other' end as state_group
,count(distinct id_bioguide) as legislators            
FROM legislators_terms a 
JOIN
(
    SELECT state
    ,count(distinct id_bioguide)
    ,rank() over (order by count(distinct id_bioguide) desc) 
    FROM legislators_terms

## Page 417

GROUP BY 1
) b on a.state = b.state
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
state_group  legislators
-----------  -----------
Other        8317
NY           1494
PA           1075
OH           694
IL           509
VA           451
Several of the states change in this second list. If we continue to update the data
set with fresh data points, the dynamic query will ensure that the output always
reflects the current top values.
Dimensionality can also be reduced by transforming the data into flag values.
Flags are usually binary (i.e., they have only two values). BOOLEAN TRUE and
FALSE can be used to encode flags, as can 1 and 0, “Yes” and “No,” or any
other pair of meaningful strings. Flags are useful when a threshold value is
important, but detail beyond that is less interesting. For example, we might want
to know whether or not a website visitor completed a purchase, but detail on the
exact number of purchases is less important.
In the legislators data set, there are 28 distinct numbers of terms served by
the legislators. Instead of the exact value, however, we might want to include in
our output only whether a legislator has served at least two terms, which we can
do by turning the detailed values into a flag:
SELECT case when terms >= 2 then true else false end as two_terms_flag
,count(*) as legislators
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide
    ,count(term_id) as terms
    FROM legislators_terms
    GROUP BY 1
) a
GROUP BY 1
;

## Page 418

two_terms_flag  legislators
--------------  -----------
false           4139
true            8379
About twice as many legislators have served at least two terms as compared to
those with only one term. When combined with other fields in a data set, this
type of transformation can result in much smaller result sets.
Sometimes a simple true/false or presence/absence indicator is not quite enough
to capture the needed nuance. In this case, numeric data can be transformed into
several levels to maintain some additional detail. This is accomplished with a
CASE statement, and the return value can be a number or string.
We might want to include not only whether a legislator served a second term but
also another indicator for those who served 10 or more terms:
SELECT 
case when terms >= 10 then '10+'
     when terms >= 2 then '2 - 9'
     else '1' end as terms_level
,count(*) as legislators
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide
    ,count(term_id) as terms
    FROM legislators_terms
    GROUP BY 1
) a
GROUP BY 1
;
terms_level  legislators
-----------  -----------
1            4139
2 - 9        7496
10+          883
Here we have reduced 28 distinct values down to 3, while retaining the notion of
single-term legislators, those who were reelected, and the ones who are
exceptionally good at staying in office. Such groupings or distinctions occur in
many domains. As with all the transformations discussed here, it may take some
trial and error to find the exact thresholds that are most meaningful for

## Page 419

stakeholders. Finding the right balance of detail and aggregation can greatly
decrease data set size and therefore often speeds delivery time and performance
of the downstream application.
PII and Data Privacy
Data privacy is one of the most important issues facing data professionals today.
Large data sets with many attributes allow for more robust analysis with detailed
insights and recommendations. However, when the data set is about individuals,
we need to be mindful of both the ethical and the regulatory dimensions of the
data collected and used. Regulations around the privacy of patients, students, and
financial services customers have existed for many years. Laws regulating the
data privacy rights of consumers have also come into force in recent years. The
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) passed by the EU is probably the
most widely known. Other regulations include the California Consumer Privacy
Act (CCPA), the Australian Privacy Principles, and Brazil’s General Data
Protection Law (LGPD).
These and other regulations cover the handling, storage, and (in some cases)
deletion of personally identifiable information (PII). Some categories of PII are
obvious: name, address, email, date of birth, and Social Security number. PII
also includes health indicators such as heart rate, blood pressure, and medical
diagnoses. Location information, such as GPS coordinates, is also considered
PII, since a small number of GPS locations can uniquely identify an individual.
For example, GPS readings at my house and at my children’s school could
uniquely identify someone in my household. A third GPS point at my office
could uniquely identify me. As a data practitioner, it’s worthwhile to become
familiar with what these regulations cover and to discuss how they affect your
work with the privacy lawyers at your organization, who will have the most up-
to-date information.
A best practice when analyzing data that includes PII is to avoid including the
PII itself in the outputs. This can be accomplished by aggregating data,
substituting values, or hashing values.
For most analyses, the goal is to find trends and patterns. Counting customers
and averaging their behavior, rather than including individual detail in the
output, is often the purpose. Aggregations generally remove PII; however, be

## Page 420

aware that a combination of attributes that have a user count of 1 could
potentially be tied back to an individual. These can be treated as outliers and
removed from the result in order to maintain a higher degree of privacy.
If individual data is needed for some reason—to be able to calculate distinct
users in a downstream tool, for instance—we can replace problematic values
with random alternate values that maintain uniqueness. The row_number
window function can be used to assign a new value to each individual in a table:
SELECT email
,row_number() over (order by ...) 
FROM users
;
The challenge in this case is to find a field to put in the ORDER BY that makes
the ordering sufficiently random such that we can consider the resulting user
identifier anonymized.
Hashing values is another option. Hashing takes an input value and uses an
algorithm to create a new output value. A particular input value will always
result in the same output, making this a good option for maintaining uniqueness
while obscuring sensitive values. The md5 function can be used to generate a
hashed value:
SELECT md5('my info');
md5
--------------------------------
0fb1d3f29f5dd1b7cabbad56cf043d1a
WARNING
The md5 function hashes input values but does not encrypt them, and therefore it can be
reversed to obtain the original value. For highly sensitive data, you should work with a
database administrator to truly encrypt the data.
Avoiding PII in the output of your SQL queries is always the best option if
possible, since you avoid proliferating it into other systems or files. Replacing or
masking the values is a second-best option. You can also explore secure methods

## Page 421

to share data, such as developing a secured data pipeline directly between a
database and an email system to avoid writing email addresses out to files, for
example. With care and partnership with technical and legal colleagues, it is
possible to achieve high-quality analysis while also preserving individuals’
privacy.
Conclusion
Surrounding every analysis, there are a number of decisions to be made around
organizing the code, managing complexity, optimizing query performance, and
safeguarding privacy in the output. In this chapter, we’ve discussed a number of
options and strategies and special SQL syntax that can help with these tasks. Try
not to get overwhelmed by all of these options or to become concerned that,
without mastery of these topics, you can’t be an efficient data analyst or data
scientist. Not all of the techniques are required in every analysis, and there are
often other ways to get the job done. The longer you spend analyzing data with
SQL, the more likely you are to come across situations in which one or more of
these techniques come in handy.
1  Though in the case of Tableau, you can get around this with the Initial SQL option.

## Page 422

Chapter 9. Conclusion
Throughout the book, we’ve seen how SQL is a flexible and powerful language
for a range of data analysis tasks. From data profiling to time series, text
analysis, and anomaly detection, SQL can tackle a number of common
requirements. Techniques and functions can also be combined in any given SQL
statement to perform experiment analysis and build complex data sets. While
SQL can’t accomplish all analysis goals, it fits well into the ecosystem of
analysis tools.
In this final chapter, I’ll discuss a few additional types of analysis and point out
how various SQL techniques covered in the book can be combined to
accomplish them. Then I’ll wrap up with some resources that you can use to
continue your journey of mastering data analysis or to dig deeper into specific
topics.
Funnel Analysis
A funnel consists of a series of steps that must be completed to reach a defined
goal. The goal might be registering for a service, completing a purchase, or
obtaining a course completion certificate. Steps in a website purchase funnel, for
example, might include clicking the “Add to Cart” button, filling out shipping
information, entering a credit card, and finally clicking the “Place Order” button.
Funnel analysis combines elements of time series analysis, discussed in
Chapter 3, and cohort analysis, discussed in Chapter 4. The data for funnel
analysis comes from a time series of events, although in this case those events
correspond to distinct real-world actions rather than being repetitions of the
same event. Measuring retention from step to step is a key goal of funnel
analysis, although in this context we often use the term conversion. Typically,
entities drop out along the steps of the process, and a graph of their number at
each stage ends up looking like a household funnel—hence the name.
This type of analysis is used to identify areas of friction, difficulty, or confusion.
Steps at which large numbers of users drop out, or that many fail to complete,

## Page 423

provide insight into opportunities for optimization. For example, a checkout
process that asks for credit card information before showing the total amount
including shipping might turn off some would-be purchasers. Showing the total
before this step may encourage more purchase completions. Such changes are
often subjects of experiments, discussed in Chapter 7. Funnels can also be
monitored in order to detect unexpected external events. For example, changes
in completion rates might correspond to good (or bad) PR or to a change in the
pricing or tactics of a competitor.
The first step in a funnel analysis is to figure out the base population of all users,
customers, or other entities that were eligible to enter the process. Next,
assemble the data set of completion for each step of interest, including the final
goal. Often this includes one or more LEFT JOINs in order to include all of the
base population, along with those who completed each step. Then count the
users in each step and divide these step-wise counts by the total count. There
are two ways to set up the queries, depending on whether all steps are required.
When all steps in the funnel are required—or if you only want to include users
who have completed all steps—LEFT JOIN each table to the previous table:
SELECT count(a.user_id) as all_users
,count(b.user_id) as step_one_users
,count(b.user_id) / count(a.user_id) as pct_step_one
,count(c.user_id) as step_two_users
,count(c.user_id) / count(b.user_id) as pct_one_to_two
FROM users a
LEFT JOIN step_one b on a.user_id = b.user_id
LEFT JOIN step_two c on b.user_id = c.user_id
;
When users can skip a step, or if you want to allow for this possibility, LEFT
JOIN each table to the one containing the full population and calculate the share
of that starting group:
SELECT count(a.user_id) as all_users
,count(b.user_id) as step_one_users
,count(b.user_id) / count(a.user_id) as pct_step_one
,count(c.user_id) as step_two_users
,count(c.user_id) / count(b.user_id) as pct_step_two
FROM users a
LEFT JOIN step_one b on a.user_id = b.user_id

## Page 424

LEFT JOIN step_two c on a.user_id = c.user_id
;
It’s a subtle difference, but it’s one worth paying attention to and tailoring to the
specific context. Consider including time boxes, to only include users who
complete an action within a specific time frame, if users can reenter the funnel
after a lengthy absence. Funnel analyses can also include additional dimensions,
such as cohort or other entity attributes, to facilitate comparisons and generate
additional hypotheses about why a funnel is or is not performing well.
Churn, Lapse, and Other Definitions of
Departure
The topic of churn came up in Chapter 4, since churn is  essentially the opposite
of retention. Often organizations want or need to come up with a specific
definition of churn in order to measure it directly. In some cases, there is a
contractually defined end date, such as with B2B software. But often churn is a
fuzzier concept, and a time-based definition is more appropriate. Even when
there is a contractual end date, measuring when a customer stops using a product
can be an early warning sign of an imminent contract cancellation. Churn
definitions can also be applied to certain products or features, even when the
customer doesn’t churn from the organization entirely.
A time-based churn metric counts customers as churned when they haven’t
purchased or interacted with a product for a period of time, usually ranging from
30 days to as much as a year. The exact length depends a lot on the type of
business and on typical usage patterns. To arrive at a good churn definition, you
can use gap analysis to find typical periods between purchases or usage. To do
gap analysis, you will need a time series of actions or events, the lag window
function, and some date math.
As an example, we can calculate the typical gaps between representatives’ terms,
using the legislators data set introduced in Chapter 4. We’ll ignore the fact that
politicians are often voted out of office rather than choosing to leave, since
otherwise this data set has the right structure for this type of analysis. First we’ll
find the average gap. To do this, we create a subquery that calculates the gap
between the start_date and the previous start_date for each legislator

## Page 425

for each term, and then we find the average value in the outer query. The
previous start_date can be found using the lag function, and the gap as a
time interval is calculated with the age function:
SELECT avg(gap_interval) as avg_gap
FROM

As we might expect, the average is close to two years, which makes sense since
the term length for this office is two years. We can also create a distribution of
gaps in order to pick a realistic churn threshold. In this case, we’ll transform the
gap to months:
SELECT gap_months, count(*) as instances
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide, term_start
    ,lag(term_start) over (partition by id_bioguide 
                           order by term_start)

If date_part is not supported in your database, extract can be used as an
alternative. (Refer to Chapter 3 for an explanation and examples.) The output
can be plotted, as in Figure 9-1. Since there is a long tail of months, this plot is
zoomed in to show the range in which most gaps fall. The most common gap is
24 months, but there are also several hundred instances per month out to 32
months. There is another small bump to over 100 at 47 and 48 months. With the
average and distribution in hand, I would likely set a threshold of either 36 or 48
months and say that any representative who hasn’t been reelected within this
window has “churned.”

## Page 428

59 months
Once you have a defined threshold for churn, you can monitor the customer base
with a “time since last” analysis. This can refer to last purchase, last payment,
last time an app was opened, or whatever time-based metric is relevant for the
organization. For this calculation, you need a data set that has the most recent
date or timestamp for each customer. If starting with a time series, first find the
most recent timestamp for each customer in a subquery. Then apply date math to
find the time elapsed between that date and the current date, or the latest date in
the data set if some time has elapsed since the data was assembled.
For example, we could find the distribution of years since the last election from
the legislators_terms table. In the subquery, calculate the latest starting
date using the max function and then find the time elapsed since then using the
age function. In this case, the maximum data in the data set, May 5, 2019, is
used. In a data set with up-to-date data, substitute current_date or an
equivalent expression. The outer query finds the years from the interval using
date_part and counts the number of legislators:
SELECT date_part('year',interval_since_last) as years_since_last
,count(*) as reps
FROM
(
    SELECT id_bioguide
    ,max(term_start) as max_date
    ,age('2020-05-19',max(term_start)) as interval_since_last
    FROM legislators_terms
    WHERE term_type = 'rep'
    GROUP BY 1
) a
GROUP BY 1
;

1.0               440
2.0               1
...               ...
A related concept is “lapsed,” which is often used as an intermediate stage

## Page 429

between fully active customers and churned customers and might alternatively
be called “dormant.” A lapsed customer may be at higher risk of churning
because we haven’t seen them for a while but still have a decent likelihood of
returning based on our past experience. In consumer services, I’ve seen “lapsed”
cover periods from 7 to 30 days, with “churned” being defined as a customer not
using the service for more than 30 days. Companies often experiment with
reactivating lapsed users, using tactics ranging from email to support team
outreach. Customers in each state can be defined by first finding their “time
since last” as above and then tagging them with a CASE statement using the
appropriate number of days or months. For example, we can group the
representatives according to how long ago they were elected:
SELECT 
case when months_since_last <= 23 then 'Current'
     when months_since_last <= 48 then 'Lapsed'
     else 'Churned' 
     end as status
,sum(reps) as total_reps

    SELECT 
    date_part('year',interval_since_last) * 12

## Page 430

This data set contains more than two hundred years of legislator terms, so of
course many of the people included have died, and some are still living but are
retired. In the context of a business, we would hope that our churned customers
didn’t outnumber our current customers by such a wide margin, and we would
want to know more about the lapsed customers.
Most organizations are very concerned about churn, since customers are
generally more expensive to acquire than to retain. To learn more about the
customers in any status or about the range of time since last seen, these analyses
can be further sliced by any of the customer attributes available in the data set.
Basket Analysis
I have three kids, and when I go to the grocery store, my basket (or more often
my shopping cart) fills up quickly with grocery items to feed them for the week.
Milk, eggs, and bread are usually in there, but other items might change
depending on what produce is in season, whether the kids are in school or on
break, or if we’re planning to cook a special meal. Basket analysis takes its name
from the practice of analyzing the products consumers buy together to find
patterns that can be used for marketing, store placement, or other strategic
decisions. The goal of a basket analysis may be to find groups of items
purchased together. It can also be framed around a particular product: when
someone buys ice cream, what else do they buy?
Although basket analysis was originally framed around items purchased together
in a single transaction, the concept can be extended in several ways. A retailer or
an ecommerce store might be interested in the basket of items a customer
purchases across their lifetime. Services and product feature usage can also be
analyzed in this fashion. Services that are commonly purchased together might
be bundled into a new offering, such as when travel sites offer deals if a flight,
hotel, and rental car are booked together. Product features that are used together
might be placed in the same navigation window or used to make suggestions for
where to go next in an application. Basket analysis can also be used to identify
stakeholder personas, or segments, which are then used in other types of
analysis.
To find the most common baskets, using all items in a basket, we can use the

## Page 431

string_agg function (or an analogous one, depending on the type of database
—see Chapter 5). For example, imagine we have a purchases table that has
one row for each product bought by a customer_id. First, use the
string_agg function to find the list of products purchased by each customer
in a subquery. Then GROUP BY this list and count the number of customers:
SELECT products
,count(customer_id) as customers
FROM
(
    SELECT customer_id
    ,string_agg(product,', ') as products
    FROM purchases
    GROUP BY 1
) a
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
;
This technique works well when there is a relatively small number of possible
items. Another option is to find pairs of products purchased together. To do this,
self-JOIN the purchases table to itself, JOINing on the customer_id. The
second JOIN condition solves the problem of duplicate entries that differ only in
their order. For example, imagine a customer who purchased apples and bananas
—without this clause, the result set would include “apples, bananas” and
“bananas, apples.” The clause b.product > a.product ensures only one
of these variations is included and also filters out results in which a product is
matched with itself:
SELECT product1, product2
,count(customer_id) as customers
FROM
(
    SELECT a.customer_id
    ,a.product as product1
    ,b.product as product2
    FROM purchases a
    JOIN purchases b on a.customer_id = b.customer_id 
    and b.product > a.product
) a
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 desc
;

## Page 432

This can be extended to include three or more products by adding additional
JOINs. To include baskets that contain only one item, change the JOIN to a
LEFT JOIN.
There are a few common challenges when running a basket analysis. The first is
performance, particularly when there is a large catalog of products, services, or
features. The resultant calculations can become slow on the database,
particularly when the goal is to find groups of three or more items, and thus the
SQL contains three or more self-JOINs. Consider filtering the tables with
WHERE clauses to remove infrequently purchased items before performing the
JOINs. Another challenge occurs when a few items are so common that they
swamp all other combinations. For example, milk is so frequently purchased that
groups with it and any other item top the list of combinations. The query results,
while accurate, may still be meaningless in a practical sense. In this case,
consider removing the most common items entirely, again with a WHERE
clause, before performing the JOINs. This should have the added benefit of
improving query performance by making the data set smaller.
A final challenge with basket analysis is the self-fulfilling prophecy. Items that
show up together in a basket analysis may then be marketed together, increasing
the frequency with which they are purchased together. This may strengthen the
case to market them together further, leading to more copurchasing, and so on.
Products that are even better matches may never have a chance, simply because
they didn’t appear in the original analysis and become candidates for promotion.
The famous beer and diapers correlation is only one example of this. Various
machine learning techniques and large online companies have tried to tackle this
problem, and there are plenty of interesting directions for analysis in this area
still to be developed.
Resources
Data analysis as a profession (or even as a hobby!) requires a mix of technical
proficiency, domain knowledge, curiosity, and communication skills. I thought I
would share some of my favorite resources so that you might draw on them as
you continue your journey, both to learn more and to practice your new skills on

## Page 433

real data sets.
Books and Blogs
Although this book assumes a working knowledge of SQL, good resources for
the basics or for a refresher are:
Forta, Ben. Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes a Day. 5th ed.
Hoboken, NJ: Sams, 2020.
The software company Mode offers a SQL tutorial with an interactive
query interface, useful for practicing your skills.
There is no single universally accepted SQL style, but you may find the SQL
Style Guide and the Modern SQL Style Guide useful. Note that their styles don’t
exactly match those used in this book, or each other. I believe that using a style
that is both consistent with itself and readable is the most important
consideration.
Your approach to analysis and to communicating the results can often matter just
as much as the code you write. Two good books for sharpening both aspects are:
Hubbard, Douglas W. How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of
“Intangibles” in Business. 2nd ed. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2010.
Kahneman, Daniel. Thinking, Fast and Slow. New York: Farrar, Straus
and Giroux, 2011.
The Towards Data Science blog is a great source for articles about many analysis
topics. Although many of the posts there focus on Python as a programming
language, approaches and techniques can often be adapted to SQL.
For an amusing take on correlation versus causation, see Tyler Vigen’s Spurious
Correlations.
Regular expressions can be tricky. If you’re looking to increase your
understanding or to solve complex cases not covered in this book, a good
resource is:
Forta, Ben. Learning Regular Expressions. Boston: Addison-Wesley,
2018.

## Page 434

Randomized testing has a long history and touches many fields across the natural
and social sciences. Compared to statistics, however, analysis of online
experiments is still relatively new. Many classic statistics texts give a good
introduction but discuss problems in which the sample size is very small, so they
fail to address many of the unique opportunities and challenges of online testing.
A couple of good books that discuss online experiments are:
Georgiev, Georgi Z. Statistical Methods in Online A/B Testing. Sofia,
Bulgaria: self-published, 2019.
Kohavi, Ron, Diane Tang, and Ya Xu. Trustworthy Online Controlled
Experiments: A Practical Guide to A/B Testing. Cambridge, UK:
Cambridge University Press, 2020.
Evan Miller’s Awesome A/B Tools has calculators for both binary and
continuous outcome experiments, as well as several other tests that may be
useful for experiment designs beyond the scope of this book.
Data Sets
The best way to learn and improve your SQL skills is to put them to use on real
data. If you are employed and have access to a database within your
organization, that’s a good place to start since you probably already have context
on how the data is produced and what it means. There are plenty of interesting
public data sets that you can analyze instead, however, and these range across a
wide variety of topics. Listed below are a few good places to start when looking
for interesting data sets:
Data Is Plural is a newsletter of new and interesting data sets, and the
Data Is Plural archive is a searchable treasure trove of data sets.
FiveThirtyEight is a journalism site that covers politics, sports, and
science through a data lens. The data sets behind the stories are on the
FiveThirtyEight GitHub site.
Gapminder is a Swedish foundation that publishes yearly data for many
human and economic development indicators, including many sourced
from the World Bank.

## Page 435

The United Nations publishes a number of statistics. The UN’s
Department of Economic and Social Affairs produces data on
population dynamics in a relatively easy-to-use format.
Kaggle hosts data analysis competitions and has a library of data sets
that can be downloaded and analyzed even outside of the formal
competitions.
Many governments at all levels, from national to local, have adopted the
open data movement and publish various statistics. Data.gov maintains
a list of sites both in the United States and around the world that is a
good starting point.
Final Thoughts
I hope you’ve found the techniques and code in this book useful. I believe that
it’s important to have a good foundation in the tools you’re using, and there are
many useful SQL functions and expressions that can make your analyses faster
and more accurate. Developing great analysis skills isn’t just about learning the
latest fancy techniques or language, however. Great analysis comes from asking
good questions; taking the time to understand the data and the domain; applying
appropriate analysis techniques to come up with high-quality, reliable answers;
and finally, communicating the results to your audience in a way that is relevant
and supports decision making. Even after almost 20 years of working with SQL,
I still get excited about finding new ways to apply it, new data sets to apply it to,
and all of the insights in the world patiently waiting to be discovered.

Colophon
The animal on the cover of SQL for Data Analysis is a green magpie (Cissa
chinensis). Usually referred to as the common green magpie, this jewel-toned
bird is a member of the crow family. Found throughout the lowland evergreen
and bamboo forests of northeastern India, central Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra,
and northwestern Borneo, this species of bird is noisy and highly social. In the
wild, they can be identified by their jade-colored plumage, which contrasts
elegantly with their red beak and a black band running along the eyes. They also
have a white-tipped tail and reddish wings.
Highly social and noisy, the green magpie can be identified by its piercing
shrieks followed by a hollow and decisive-sounding “chup” note. They are also
often difficult to spot because they glide from tree to tree in the middle-upper
levels of the forest. They build their nests in trees, large shrubs, and tangles of
various climbing vines. Sometimes referred to as the hunting cissas, they are
primarily carnivorous—consuming a variety of invertebrates, as well as young
birds and eggs, small reptiles, and mammals.
The green magpie is fascinating because of its ability to change colors. Although
they are jade green in the wild, they have been observed to turn distinctly
turquoise in captivity. They get their green coloration from a combination of two
sources: a special feather structure that produces blue coloring due to the feather
refracting light, and carotenoids—yellow, orange, and red pigments that come
from the bird’s diet. Prolonged exposure to harsh sunlight destroys the
carotenoids, hence making the bird appear turquoise.
The green magpie species has an extremely large range and although the
population trend seems to be decreasing, the decline is not rapid enough to push
the species into the Vulnerable category. As such, their current conservation
status is “Least Concern.”
